You can choose any method:

1. Use Visual C++ 2008 and solution file CE.sln from this folder

2. Use Visual C++ nmake (2008) and makefile_all_vc.
   Example: nmake /F makefile_all_vc
   ! This method requires libCRT.lib (libCRT64.lib),
   ! placed in 'common' subfolder.
   ! Theese files must be compiled from Far 3 sources.

3. Use GnuC (MinGW) and makefile_all_gcc.
   Example: mingw32-make -f makefile_all_gcc WIDE=1
   ! This method was tested only for x86 builds.
