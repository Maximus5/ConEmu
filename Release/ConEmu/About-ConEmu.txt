ConEmu - Windows Console Emulator


About ConEmu

    ConEmu-Maximus5 is a Windows console emulator with tabs, which represents
    multiple consoles and simple GUI applications as one customizable GUI window
    with various features.
    Basic application - joint use with Far Manager.
    Far (File and Archive) Manager is a console program for managing files and
    archives in Windows operating systems.

    This fork grew up from ConEmu by Zoin. 


Description

    ConEmu starts a console program in hidden console window and provides an
    alternative customizable GUI window with various features:
    * smooth and friendly window resizing;
    * tabs for editors, viewers, panels and consoles;
    * run simple GUI apps in tabs;
    * easy run old DOS applications (games) in Windows 7 or 64bit OS;
    * thumbnails and tiles in Far Manager;
    * normal, maximized and full screen window graphic modes;
    * window font anti-aliasing: standard, clear type, disabled;
    * window fonts: family, height, width, bold, italic, etc.;
    * BDF fonts limited support;
    * using normal/bold/italic fonts for different parts of console simultaneously;
    * using 24bit colors in Far Manager 3.x;
    * cursor: standard console (horisontal) or GUI (vertical);
    * optional settings (e.g. pallette) for selected applications;
    * for BufferHeight mode: vertical scrolling using keyboard;
    * show full output (1K+ lines) of last command in editor/viewer;
    * customizable Far Manager right click behaviour (long click opens context menu);
    * drag and drop (explorer style) of files and folders in Far Manager;
    * user friendly text and block selection;
    * transparency and desktop mode;
    * customizable starting tabs;
    * and more, and more... take a look at Settings dialog, WhatsNew and Settings.reg 

    All settings are read from the registry or xml file (multiple named
    configurations are supported) and after that the command line parameters
    are applied. Parameters /Config and /BufferHeight are only for command
    line. Most of settings are changed only in the Settings dialog, not from
    the command line.


Requirements
    Windows 2000 or later.


Installation
    1. Unpack all files (from appropriate "ConEmu.*.7z") to the folder,
       Note, if You are not using FAR manager, You may unpack files to any folder.
       Warning, cause of frequent breaks of Far 3 API, it's strongly recommended
       to use latest developer build, when you are using Far 3. 
    2. Import Far Manager macroses, related to ConEmu. Macro files are located in
       ConEmu.Addons directory. Each macro file has description in header.
    3. By default (started without command line params), ConEmu runs "far.exe"
       from it's home folder, or "cmd.exe" if Far Manager not found.
       Alternatively, You may specify any root command, specifying
       "/Cmd <App with params>" argument in ConEmu shortcut or command line.


Command Line Syntax
	ConEmu [/CT] [/FS | /MAX] [/Font ..] [/Size ..] [/FontFile ..] [/Config ..]
	       [/Single] [/BufferHeight ..] [/Multi | /NoMulti] [/Cmd ..]

    Started without params, ConEmu runs "far.exe" from it's home folder.

Parameters
	/?
	Shows help screen.

	/CT
	ClearType anti-aliasing.

	/FS
	Full screen mode.

	/MAX
	Maximized window mode.

	/Font <fontname>
	Specifies the font name.

	/Size <fontsize>
	Specifies the font size.

	/FontFile <fontfilename> - Loads fonts from file. You may specify more
	than one font file. First of them (except /Font specified) become main
	font.

	/Config <configname>
	Tells to use an existing or create a new configuration with the specified
	name. Each configuration keeps its own individual data in the registry or
	xml file (ConEmu.xml).

	/Single
	New console will be started in new tab of existing ConEmu.

	/BufferHeight <height>
	Sets console buffer height and tells to use keys CtrlUp, CtrlDn, CtrlPgUp,
	CtrlPgDn for vertical scrolling. This mode should not be used for programs
	like FAR where buffer and window height are equal.

	/Multi
	Turn on MultiConsole feature (several consoles in one ConEmu window,
	'long console output' feature).

	/Cmd <commandline>
	/Cmd @<commandfile>
	This MUST be the LAST switch.
    The rest (<commandline>) is treated as a command to start and its
    parameters. By default ConEmu uses a command from saved configuration, if
    any, otherwise it tries to starts Far in normal mode or Cmd in
    /BufferHeight mode.
    You may use @<commandfile> instead of <commandline> to start several
    consoles simultaneously in one ConEmu instance.
    Sample startfile.txt:
      >"C:\Program Files\Far\far.exe"
      */BufferHeight 400 cmd
      /BufferHeight 1000 powershell


Command Line Examples
	ConEmu.exe /CT /Font "Lucida Console" /Size 16 /Cmd Far.exe "c:\1 2\"
	ConEmu.exe /Config ScrollMode /BufferHeight 9999 /Cmd PowerShell.exe
