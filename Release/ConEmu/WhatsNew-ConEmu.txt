-------------------------------------------


2016.12.6
* gh-970: Pasting windows path in cygwin produces truncated result (77eb4e6 regression).
* Allow to pass empty string via -cur_console:m:"" (set no mount prefix for Unix path conversion).
* gh-552: Templates %m...m, %M...M - show mark ‘...’ for active (m) and inactive (M) tab.
  So, if you want to see ‘• ’ mark on the active tab (to emboss active tab)
  just change your console tab template to smth like: ‘%m• m<%c> %s’.
  https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsTabBar.html#id2106
* Don't show Assertions in ‘Stable’ releases.


2016.12.3
* StatusBar. new column ‘Cell Info’ shows information about cell under cursor: UCS & ConAttr.
  CellInfo is turned on by default in ‘-basic’ mode to simplify bugreporting.
* gh-809: Support mount root for unix-path conversion.
  ConEmu tries to choose mount root automatically, if user have not defined
  it explicitly with ‘-cur_console:m:/mnt’ switch.
  For example, to use ‘/cygdrive’ just run your console with switch:
  ‘-cur_console:m:/cygdrive’.
* In some cases ConEmu window was closed unexpectedly during initialization.
  That happend if delay between consoles initialization was greater
  than first console run duration. So, ConEmu was closed before second
  console process was created.
* gh-943: Rename option to ‘Change mouse cursor if busy’.
* Add switch `ConEmuC -IsRedirect` to determine if CONOUT is redirected.
* Force enable mouse events processing in KeyEvents.
* gh-964: Let default {Far} task load plugins from FARPROFILE.
* gh-927: Appropriate behavior while posting chars with AltGr pressed.
  Example: `print("*")` when Lithuanian keyboard layout is selected.
* Support clickable links like 'example-protocol://someurl'.
  Origin: http://superuser.com/q/1152465/139371


2016.10.22
* gh-910: Fix regression: slower startup.
* File `wsl-con.cmd` was created by msi in wrong folder.
* Far Macro. Some improvements in ConEmu.CtrlNumber.lua
* Console test (ConEmuC -checkunicode) improved.
* gh-919: Fix misprint.
* Some internal changes in hooking: support KernelBase for installing injects.


2016.10.9a
* gh-896: Fix regression: cygwin/msys process creation was broken.


2016.10.9
* GuiMacro: Allow {Task} arguments in `Shell` function.
* Reuse previous palette on Unfasten/Re-Attach.
* gh-888: Allow to use ConEmu as default console in third-party applications.
* DefTerm. Reinit some functions in SetAllHook
* gh-830: Fix: Significant dwm.exe CPU time when renamed ConEmu tab is active.
* gh-886: Settings / Integration: When ‘Shift’ is pressed during ‘Register’ button click,
  ConEmu's ‘Here’ and ‘Inside’ items are registered as ‘extended’ menu items,
  and they are shown by Explorer only when ‘Shift’ is pressed.
* Show process startup time in SysInfo and LogFiles.
* Far macro emulating `Ctrl+Number` on `LCtrl+Shift+Number` keypress.


2016.10.2
* gh-879: Fix doubled CJK glyphs on Windows 10 build 14931.
  Windows 10 (since 14931) has changed behavior for double-cell glyphs. Now they are
  doubled (COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE/COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE) even for UTF-8 codepage.
* gh-871: Selection was not working in Alternative mode.
* Turn on certain StatusBar columns on `-basic` switch.
* Switch `/OMITHOOKSWARN` was passed improperly to server when `/log` was defined.
* Sample file demonstrates ability to use 256 colors in Windows Subsystem for Linux
  started in ConEmu tab.


2016.9.14
* gh-863: Unchecking option ‘Kill ssh-agent with ConEmu’ had no effect.
* Suggest `%UserProfile%\ConEmu\Logs` as default location for ANSI logs.


2016.9.13
* Add option to kill `ssh-agent.exe` processes started from ConEmu's consoles
  on ConEmu termination. Read more at: https://conemu.github.io/en/SshAgent.html
* Installer was signed without timestamp.


2016.9.4
* GuiMacro: Detach(1) didn't disable confirmation.
* gh-841: Support COMMON_LVB_REVERSE_VIDEO console attribute.
* gitextensions/gitextensions#3263: Inside mode: Don't run console ‘As Admin’ if Shift is pressed.

  Remove ambiguous option to run started elevated console (Run As Admin).
  If ConEmu was started by some shortcut with `Shift` key,
  user faced the unexpected UAC confirmation.

  If user want to run elevated console, they may use special Task
  with `-cur_console:a` switch. Example: {cmd (Admin)}.

  If developer want to run ConEmu console in elevated mode,
  they may add `-cur_console:a` switch *after* `-run` switch.
  Example: `ConEmu.exe -run cmd.exe -cur_console:a /k <some command>`.


2016.8.28
* gi-821: Fixed crash on startup if Explorer is not started.
* Support sha256 checksum in chocolatey package.
* gh-832: Fix crash on erasing ‘Settings->Keys & Macro->Mark/Copy->Exceptions’.
* gh-766: Prefer 'TEMP' env.var over GetTempPath function.
* GuiMacro: Let Detach(1) do the work without confirmation.


2016.7.24
* gh-780: Fix crash on drawing certain text data.


2016.7.10
* gh-766: ConEmuSetup improvements and error handling.
  * Don't show MessageBox in auto mode (chocolatey, autoupdate);
  * Log error messages to log-file in the exe's folder;
  * In case TEMP directory is inaccessible, just use exe's folder.
* gh-740: Try to convert paths to cygwin style if clipboard doesn't contain `\n` while pasting to cygwin/msys shells.
* In some cases ‘Alternative font’ was not used for first cell in a row (1536b94 regression).


2016.7.7
* gh-752: Fn keys were not processed by Keys GuiMacro.
* gh-742: Improve installer error reporting, don't show error code twice.
* gh-739: New option ‘Compress long strings to fit space’ is turned on by default.
  By unchecking that option you'll get ‘old’ behavior, when ConEmu just trims text,
  which overruns dedicated space. Read comments in the issue for details:
  https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/739
* In some cases old text was not cleared properly with a consequent garbage on the screen.
* gh-741: Text compression/expansion logic changed, using ‘elasticity’ now.
* In some cases Font changes were not applied properly.
* gh-741, gh-722: Glyphs widths evaluation and alignment were changed.
  So, symbols are expected to be painted properly, uncropped.
  Examples: U+276F (❯), U+2794 (➔), U+27F6 (⟶).
* gh-761: Support ‘Terminate all but shell’ for git-cmd.exe.


2016.6.19
* Command ‘ConEmuC -ConInfo’ prints current console tech info.
* Let intercept GetWindowLong(GWL_STYLE) for console window handle (ref gh-727, gh-719).
  Far 3.0 since build 4698 tries to query GWL_STYLE for console window?
* l10n. New language resources.
* gh-735: Add all marked tasks to Jump List, use TaskBar history limit value only for History items.
* gh-740: Conversion to linux path on paste was not working for ‘Single line’ mode.
* Option ‘Autoupdate’ on Settings/TaskBar/Windows 7 Taskbar.
  If checked, Jump Lists will be updated automatically when user check
  the ‘Taskbar jump lists’ checkbox in Task properties.
* Do not add new Tasks to Jump List by default, let user explicitly check ‘Taskbar jump lists’.
* Installer (MSI): Don't suggest Far Manager's folder by default.


2016.6.12
* Terminal modes were not displayed on Settings/Info page.
* gh-716: Cygwin/msys connector output was broken after starting nano.
* gh-722: Treat Unicode range U+2700..U+27BF as double width glyphs.
* gh-718: Minimal cursor size option was ignored for invalid console cursor size (zero size).
* gh-719: Write cursor information and console window rect to log file.
* Print more console information in `ConEmuC -checkunicode`.
* gh-723: Let ‘Minimize/Restore’ hotkey act in spite of ‘Always on top’ mode.
* Don't process (append) environment variable twice (ref gh-724).
  Example: `PATH=%ConEmuBaseDir%\Scripts;%PATH%;C:\Tools\Arc`
  So, do not add `%ConEmuBaseDir%\Scripts;` and `;C:\Tools\Arc`
  if they already exist in PATH. Only explicit comparison is done,
  so, if `C:\Tools\Arc` is in the middle of current `%PATH%`,
  it would be processed (appended).
* Fix: Console progress `0%` was detected during tab startup (regression 69439a3).
* Default task {Far}: don't double plugin folders to avoid doubled lines in F11 (Far 1.x and Far 2.x `/p` switch problem).
* gh-700: Show tab icon for Far editors and viewers if ‘Far windows’ option is off.



2016.6.9
* gh-712: Total consoles count was not displayed in the title properly (regression 7ed745b).
* gh-678: Selection vanished from screen after multiple page selection.
* System menu item ‘Debug’ -> ‘Dump screen’ saved empty png file.
* Fix Shift-Home selection in cmd.exe prompt after Tab-completion.
  First Shift-Home is expected to select the typed command without prompt.
  Sequential Shift-Home keypresses select and unselect prompt part.
* Let Shift-Home select multiline commands in cmd.exe prompt.
* gh-687: Settings page ‘Integration’ -> ‘ANSI execution’ to control allowed code and macro.
  This allows [ConEmu specific OSC](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ConEmu_specific_OSC)
  to be executed: `^]]9;6;"*macro*"^]\` and `^]]9;7;"*cmd*"^]\`.
  Since now, they allowed by default in `cmd.exe` only (were implemented for `GitShowBranch.cmd`).
  User may also disable or enable they for any process.
  Also, there is a list of allowed commands. Commands are case-sensitive, one line - one command.
  User may use `*` to allow bunch of commands by ‘mask’.



2016.6.7
* Settings simplification: radio buttons were removed from ‘Settings/Mouse/Mouse button actions’.
  In Far Manager RBtn and MBtn clicks are bypassed to console if `<No-Mod>` is selected.
* Non-unique hotkey modifier check was improved.
* Warning fixes (from Michael Lukashov).


2016.6.5
* User was enable to enter list of executables on AppDistinct settings page (regression).
* Option ‘New window’ in the create new console dialog started ConEmu with wrong arguments (no xml, etc.)
* DefTerm. Option ‘Register on OS startup’ did not use specified xml file.
* gh-698: Fix crash on copy selected text in HTML format if raster font is used.
* Fix conditon for `<BS>` key posting (ref: gh-641).
* gh-667: Alt+GrayPlus+HexNumbers changes.
  * Alt+GrayPlus is bypassed to Far Manager by default. User still may
    set up explicit hotkey for ‘Start Alt+Number mode’ action.
  * Option ‘Alt+NumpadAdd - unicode hex codebase’ on the ‘Keyboard’ page
    (has no effect in Far Manager).
* gh-629: Try to enable xterm keyboard emulation automatically (BashOnWindows).


2016.5.29
* gh-457: Support DefTerm feature for Idle (Pythonw.exe) and VisualStudio Code (code.exe).
* DefTerm: ConEmu crashed if it's closed during DefTerm initialization.
* DefTerm: Don't warn user if requested process is already closed.


2016.5.22
* gh-682: Multi-line paste Enter confirmation setting was not being saved.
* gh-681: Allow NodeJSPortable.exe to run node in the same ConEmu tab.
* gh-654: Feature ‘Drag ConEmu window by client area’ may be disabled on ‘Mouse’ Settings page.
* gh-370: Option ‘Auto save/restore opened tabs’ saved wrong split config in some cases.
* Maximus5/conemu-inside#23: Don't show Min/Max/Close buttons in the ‘Inside’ mode
* StatusBar was painted using wrong ‘fade’ status in some cases (ConEmuInside).
* ConEmu ‘Here’ and ‘Inside’ improvements (Integration Settings page).
  Now the command will be registered and displayed properly if ConEmu was
  started with special switches like `-LoadCfgFile`, `-LngFile` and others.
* Recommended: `-reuse` over `-single`. `-reuse` does not enforce ‘single’ mode in the started instance.
* gh-573: Support ANSI sequence to set cursor style (DECSCUSR, VT520).

  CSI Ps SP q - Set cursor style (DECSCUSR, VT520).
		Ps = 0  -> ConEmu's default.
		Ps = 1  -> blinking block.
		Ps = 2  -> steady block.
		Ps = 3  -> blinking underline.
		Ps = 4  -> steady underline.
		Ps = 5  -> blinking bar (xterm).
		Ps = 6  -> steady bar (xterm).

* If ‘Multiple consoles ...’ were unchecked and ConEmu window is empty
  (either `-detached` or not closed with last closed tab)
  than it was impossible to reuse empty window to create new console.
* Use proper parameters for new window (e.g. started from ‘Create new console’ dialog).


2016.5.15
* ConEmuInside: In some cases (VisualStudio pane) ConEmu failed to detect ‘focused’ state.
* Split settings page ‘Controls’ into ‘Keyboard’ and ‘Mouse’ (alignment pending).
* Settings page ‘Quake style’ for pull-down related options.
* Settings for ChildGui moved to separate page (Integration / Children GUI).
* cmderdev/cmder#929: Fullscreen was not activated properly in some cases (part of ConEmu was obscured by TaskBar).
* gh-673: GuiMacro SetWindowPosSize: fix changing size w/o changing pos (by @jcsullins).
* Was not able to use xml file from drive root.
  Now it's possible to run, for example: "ConEmu -loadcfgfile Z:\ConEmu.exe".
* Show version stage in the Settings and About dialog titles.
  E.g.: ‘About ConEmu 160506 [64] {Preview}’.
* More Settings/Debug/Exec improvements.
  CD was not captured in some cases, as a consequence
  contents of `@file` was not captured too.
  Also, `@file` processing is doing synchronously now.
* Avoid using of deprecated googlecode location for version information.
  If user had old build of ConEmu installed, and old version location info
  was stored in the xml, they would fail to receive new versions.
  Now, old deprecated locations are ignored and ConEmu uses the default
  place instead.


2016.5.4
* gh-660: Fix crash on ConEmu.exe exit (32-bit).
* Separate process creation from module/inject activities.
  On Settings/Info/Debug page new ‘Exec’ option shows only
  ShellExecute and CreateProcess activities.
  The ‘Shell’ options is unchanged: ‘Exec’ + injects + modules.
* l10n: Update resources (Debug activities).


2016.5.3
* gh-661: If ConEmu started with `-detached` switch, option ‘Close with last tab’ couldn't be changed.
* Improve debug shell logging (source of `@file` without paths).
  Settings/Info/Debug has ‘Shell’ option which shows processes creation information.
  E.g. if you run project make, and make executes `lnk @arguments`, the `arguments`
  is usually temporary file, which contains actual agruments for linking.
  ConEmu tries to locate the file (passed to `lnk` without path) and shows its
  contents in Settings/Info/Debug.


2016.4.28
* gh-472: One more fix for custom frame width (Quake) and ‘gaps’.
* Revert gh-621 patch. Just post KeyUp(Alt) before pasting.
* New feature ‘Adjust lightness of indistinguishable text’ on the ‘Colors’ settings page.
  The idea is to make text readable if certain foreground and background colors
  are indistinguishable for current palette. ConEmu will try to change the lightness
  of the foreground text.
* Draw triangles (‘’ and ‘’) internally if ‘Enhance progressbars and scrollbars’ is checked.
  This solves two problems: cleartype artifacts in statusbars (vim airline for example);
  and triangle color for adjusted lightness of indistinguishable text.
* New ConEmu.exe switch `-Frame <value>` changes desired ‘Frame width’.
* Many internal changes in font descriptors creation.


2016.4.16
* gh-629: Once more ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’.
  It's recommended now to run bash with `-cur_console:p` switch.
  **Delete trailing `1`** if you have {bash} task already.

    -cur_console:p[N] - pty modes, N - bitmask, default is 1+4
       1 - XTermKeys, 2 - BrPaste, 4 - AppCursorKeys

* Support underlined text attributes (fish autocompletion).
* ConEmu.exe switches `-run` and `-runlist` are introduced to take the place of `-cmd` and `-cmdlist`.
  * Actually, `-cmd` and `-cmdlist` are supported for compatibility reasons,
    but `-run...` switches are more convenient to avoid confusion with `cmd.exe`.
  * As before, both `/switch` and `-switch` notations are supported.
  * Also, ConEmu internals were changed to `-switch` notation.
* gh-641: Correct posting `0x7F` (which is `<BS>` on xterm) to console.
  It was posted with LEFT_CTRL_PRESSED in dwControlKeyState. We are posting `<BS>`, but not a `<Ctrl>-<BS>`.


2016.4.13
* Task for ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’ was not created properly in 32-bit ConEmu on 64-bit Win10.
  Also, it's named now just a {Bash::bash}.
* New StatusBar columns: ‘Terminal modes’ and ‘RealConsole modes’ (generally for troubleshooting).
  * ‘Terminal modes’ shows keyboard modes and some flags:
    Windows, Xterm, App cursor keys, Bracketed paste, Cygwin, msys1, msys2 or clinK.
    E.g. `XC` means `X`term keyboard mode and `C`ygwin active console application.
  * ‘RealConsole modes’ shows current values of GetConsoleMode for ConIn and ConOut.
* GuiMacro: `TermMode(<Mode>[,<Action>])`.
  Ref gh-629: To ‘fix’ arrow keys in vim in bash on Ubuntu on Windows
  one may set hotkey for macro `TermMode(2)` and switch keyboard mode
  manually when vim (linux process) is started and exited.

~~~
TermMode(<Mode>[,<Action>])
  - changes active terminal modes
    Mode==0: Keyboard emulation (Xterm/Windows)
    Mode==1: Bracketed paste
    Mode==2: Application cursor keys (DECCKM)
    Action==0: Disable mode
    Action==1: Enable mode
    Action==2: Switch mode (default)
~~~

* Suppress error message ‘Can't open console data file mapping. ErrCode=0x00000002’
  when started smth from Far and close ConEmu.
* Terminal modes and performance counters were not shown properly on first open of ‘Info’ settings page.


2016.4.11
* gh-629: Support xterm keyboard emulation for ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’.
  conhost does not do keypressed translation, if they were posted directly to console input.
  That's why switch `-cur_console:p1` must be used to turn on internal xterm emulation in ConEmu.
  So, the task {Bash-on-Ubuntu} would be:

      %windir%\system32\bash.exe -cur_console:p1

* New default task {Bash::Bash on Ubuntu} for Windows 10 (if the feature is turned on in Windows).
* gh-637, gh-626: Access vialation on entering plugin ‘ConEmu Background’.
* Environment variables: `ConEmuArgs` and `ConEmuArgs2`.
  * `ConEmuArgs` now contains only ConEmu.exe's ‘switches’ (before `-cmd` or `-cmdlist`).
  * New variable `ConEmuArgs2` contains the command only: `-cmd ...` or `-cmdlist ...`.
* Reuse `ConEmuArgs` when starting new ConEmu instance from cmd autorun.
* gh-614, gh-616: Handle commas as decimal separators in the in-console progress detection.
  This fixes `curl -# -O` looping between 0 and 9%.
* Do not apply the icon from {Task} if option ‘Show overlay icon’ is on, to avoid two similar icons, one over another.


2016.4.3a
* gh-620: ConEmu shows assertion when terminating SSH session in stermc.
* gh-624: Defaults on Settings\Integration were lost after reactivating page.


2016.4.3
* ComSpec setting page moved under DefTerm.
* Avoid attempt to hook DefTerm from multiple processes in Aggressive mode.
* Improve logging of DefTerm internals.
* gh-604: Some improvements on cmd automatic attach.
  The method may be registered on the ‘ComSpec’ settings page.
  However, it's not a recommended option, because ConEmu has very slight
  control over it, and even the logic ‘when we need to attach or not’
  is fuzzy.
* gh-604: Registration buttons were not processed properly on ConSpec settings page.
* Corrections in `-new_console` switch trimming procedure.
  * The space was not trimmed in `/C "C:\Temp\run.cmd -cur_console:o"`.
  * Unexpected assertion removed in `/C "C:\Temp\run_pause.cmd "-cur_console:o""`
* Don't run the command started by Shift-Enter from Far Manager via ConEmuC.exe.
  If one needs the command to be started in new ConEmu tab,
  than install the Macro: `ConEmu/Far3_lua/ConEmu.ShiftEnter.lua`.
* Don't bypass MouseMove events to Far Menus when selection modifiers are pressed.
* gh-621: Try to mimic standard Windows Alt+Numbers behavior.


2016.3.29
* Redesign ‘Keys & Macro’ settings page. Let `Alt+F` put focus into the ‘Filter’ field.
* Hotkey `Ctrl+Alt+Break` was not processed properly.
* LogFile was not created when ‘Internal LogFiles’ checkbox was on.
* Simplify switching between Tasks on the ‘Tasks’ settings page (Up/Down keys if checkbox/button has focus).
* gh-404, gh-322: Fix crash in the integrated applications after ConEmu update (DefTerm).
  The effect will be noticed on the **next** update.


2016.3.28
* New default hotkeys for process termination:
  * `Win+Alt+Break` - Terminate all but shell processes in the current console;
  * `Ctrl+Alt+Break` - Terminate active process in the current console.
* gh-605: Fix regressions on ‘App distinct’ settings page (EOL).
* gh-294: Add ‘Filter’ field to ‘Keys and Macro’ settings page.
* gh-318: With ES_NUMBER user can't enter negative value (X/Y).
* gh-318: Get rid of gap in Quake mode when frame width is less than 3 pix.
* gh-165: Allow to drag Quake consoles between monitors.
* Show `Ctrl+Break` but `Pause` in the hotkeys list.
* l10n. Update resources
* gh-304: Use full monitor working area for maximized/fullscreen Quake mode.


2016.3.27
* Add palette change logging. Ref: gh-599, searching for bottle neck
* gh-593: Background color index was cropped to 8-color palette after `\e[9999;1H`.
* gh-587: Fix text selection when cursor passes the selection anchor (downright).
* Update chinese translation.
* Improve double-click (word) selection.
  For example, select `daily` by double-click inside brackets of `ConEmu [daily]>`.
* ANSI: Sequence `ESC [ 1 4 t` reports terminal window size in pixels as `ESC [ 4 ; height ; width t`.
* gh-605: Fix regressions on ‘App distinct’ settings page.
* Log extended information during console shutdown.
  Ref: gh-604: Last conemu versions often can't attach to started console


2016.3.24
* Unify LogFile names: `ConEmu-gui-...`, `ConEmu-con-...`, `ConEmu-srv-...`.
* To start console as ‘System’ use `-new_console:aA` switch.
* Update {Show ANSI colors} and fit in 76 chars.
* Show compiler version and colorize output of `-Args`.
* Try to show and re-apply `-new_console:XXX` switches in ‘Recreate’ dialog.
* gh-581: Restart ConEmu after automatic update in the same directory it was started before.
* Update chinese translation.
* Update Russian translation.
* If ConEmu started with `-detached` switch, don't close it automatically when last tab is terminated.
* ConEmuC: Don't fall into `Press Enter or Esc to close console...` if invalid arguments were specified.
  This is critical, especially if our process was started under non-interactive account,
  than ExitWaitForKey causes the infinitely running process, which user can't kill easily
* ConEmuC: Don't fall into `Press Enter or Esc to close console...` if server was not connected to GUI.
  Avoid situation when `ConEmuC /ROOT` was started from running console (bare `cmd.exe`)
  and ConEmuC (our started server) was not connected to GUI, then we get infinite loop
  when ConEmuC waits for cmd termination and vice versa.
* Avoid ‘Unknown state’ appeared in the StatusBar during console startup.
* LogFiles may be enabled permanently via Settings -> Features -> ‘Internal LogFiles location’.
* CmdInit.cmd: Reset colors on each prompt (`$E[m`).
* gh-587: Fix text selection when cursor passes the selection anchor (changing selection direction).
* gh-598: Improve pasting options for `Shift+Ins` and `Ctrl+V` (multi-line text).
  Now, `Ctrl+V` will insert all lines, space-separated, and `Shift+Ins` insert
  multi-line text as before. User may change actions on the ‘Paste’ settings page.
* gh-101: Switch `-UseExport` may be specified before `-GuiMacro` to export result as env.var.
  Without `-UseExport` specified before `-GuiMacro`, ConEmuC.exe will not try
  to export GuiMacro result as environment variable `ConEmuMacroResult`
  to the parent process.
* Variable `ConEmuMacroResult` was skipped during environment exporting.
* Settings pages names localization.


2016.3.13
* On WinXP/Vista the icon in the TitleBar was unexpectedly changed to active tab icon.
* Intelligent selection: RClick over selected region will Paste selected text,
  bypassing Windows' clipboard, and Reset selection region.
* Fix garbage displayed in VCon during console startup on WinXP.
* gh-571: `ConEmu -demote ...` starts process for the wrong user.
* Log current SessionID, improve Desktop and Title representation.


2016.3.10
* TaskBar icon fixes (Overlay icon on any OS, update icon on Restart console).
  * Option ‘Show overlay icon (Win7 and higher)’ now works on any system,
    and need to be renamed. So, if TaskBar uses small icons, ConEmu shows
    icon from active console via WM_GETICON.
  * Icon was not updated on restart console with another icon.
* Updates on Intelligent selection.
  * Double and Triple clicks selection do not require modifiers.
  * Click outside selection region - would reset active selection.
  * Do `Internal Copy & Paste` if LBtn is still down and RBtn is clicked.
  * Avoid blinking on double/triple clicks.
  * Selection: In some cases Shift+DblClick slipped to console.
* gh-328: Improve double-click word selection logic.
  * Don't select space after word.
  * Don't select pseudographics before/after alphabeticals.
  * Trim trailing punctuations.
  * Trim leading punctuations except dots (e.g. `.bashrc`).
* Fix wrong quotation rules on Settings/Environment. Was not working properly:
    echo ""
    echo """C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe"" fetch --progress ""--all"" "


2016.3.8
* Option ‘Retard inactive panes’ was ignored in some cases.
* Trailing dot was not trimmed after md-style hyperlink.
* gh-420: Do not enable by default option ‘Process start’.
* Debugging purposes: `ConEmuC.exe -struct %ConEmuPID%`.
* In prompt, Shift+Home/End selects command text first, second press expands selection to line start/end.
* If selection was started from keyboard, than Del/Shift-Del/Backspace removes selected text.
  ConEmu tries to ‘map’ single Del/BS to series of keypresses to remove whole selected block.
  Only one-line selections are processed.
  Shift-Del do copying to clipboard before erasion.
* Allow persistent mouse selection. Selection will reset on Paste or Typing.
* When selection crosses anchor, behave same way if selection was started in that direction.
* ANSI: Implement `ESC ] 9 ; 12 ST` to store end of prompt message.
* l10n: Update chinese translation.


2016.3.1
* gh-562: Environment was not applied to elevated consoles.
* Window icon was changed by mistake when starting task with defined icon.
  This must happen only for startup task.
* StatusBar was not updated after root process termination.
  Especially for consoles started with `-new_console:c0` or `-new_console:c1`.
* gh-561: Tab macro `%d` was not trimmed to ‘Max tab width’.
* For TaskBar with small icons show current console icon instead of ConEmu default (option ‘Admin shield’).
* GuiMacro: `GetInfo("Root")` XML-result changes.

  Ref: Maximus5/conemu-inside#8

  State: Empty, NotStarted, Running, Exited.
  PID and ExitCode: unsigned integers.
  UpTime: milliseconds.
  Examples below.

  * If there are not consoles in ConEmu.

    <Root State="Empty" />

  * If console initialization is in progress (`ping localhost -t` for example).

    <Root State="NotStarted" Name="ping.exe" />

  * If root process was started and is running. Note, `259` in `ExitCode` is `STILL_ACTIVE` constant.

    <Root State="Running" Name="ping.exe" PID="7136" ExitCode="259" UpTime="3183" />

  * If root process was finished (terminated by `Ctrl+C` as example).

    <Root State="Exited" Name="ping.exe" PID="7136" ExitCode="3221225786" UpTime="10195" />

  * Another example for `cmd.exe` normal exit.

    <Root State="Exited" Name="cmd.exe" PID="6688" ExitCode="0" UpTime="1825" />


2016.2.28
* Fix crash when mouse wheel was scrolled over search edit box.
* Warning fixes (from Michael Lukashov).
* Intelligent selection mode was not working in Far userscreen (Panels turned off).
* gh-560: Fix true-color scrolling issues in Far 3.0.4525.
* Alt+Numbers mode improvements.
  * Hotkey (unassigned): Start Alt+Number mode to enter unicode symbol by its hex codebase.
  * Allow mode start by GuiMacro: `AltNumber([Base])`.
    * Base==0: Start Alt+Numbers in ANSI decimal mode (‘ANSI’ actually means UNICODE code points 32..255)
    * Base==10: Start Alt+Numbers in OEM decimal mode
    * Base==16: Start Alt+Numbers in hexadecimal mode
  * Alt+Numbers: If mode was started by Alt+Key (user-defined), do paste on Alt release.
  * Alt+Numbers: Show collected codebase and hints about mode in the StatusBar.
* KeyEvents v4.3: Unicode characters were not printed correctly.


2016.2.22
* gh-555: Aliases support was broken (771ab79 regression).
* Maximus5/conemu-inside#13: ConEmu-Inside position was not updated in some cases.
* Understandable error message if bad `-loadcfgfile` was specified.
* Don't erase default MSZ setting value, if one not found in xml.
* Let `-new_console:c1` consoles stay open silently even on Esc/Enter.
  When all processes in console are finished:
  * ConEmu does not close the console automatically;
  * Confirmation message is not written to console;
  * All keypresses are ignored.
  So, user may either close console via ConEmu interface
  (kill hotkeys or close menu items), or parent process
  (when ConEmu is working in the ‘Inside’ mode) may close
  the console via GuiMacro `Close(0,1)`.


2016.2.19
* Task may be executed in the running console with `ConEmuC -c {TaskName}`.

  Actually, first command of the named task is executed,
  and rest of command line is appended as arguments.
  For example, you may start Far editor in the **current**
  console by executing in the prompt:

    ConEmuC -c {Far} /e text.txt

* Support tasks nesting.

  Simple nesting is allowed, so one may create their own task,
  which starts {cmd}, {powershell} and {VS 14.0 x86 tools prompt},
  even in splits or with extra arguments. For example:

    {cmd} & echo Extra args
    {powershell} -new_console:sV

* New predefined environment variables: `ConEmuTask` and `ConEmuPalette`.
* TaskBar JumpList icons fix.
* Far Macro: ConEmu.Editor.lua was broken (Far3 latest builds).
* Far Tabs were not updated in ConEmu after plugin call `Plugin.SyncCall(ConEmu,100)`.


2016.2.18
* GuiMacro. New function `Write("Text")` writes "Text" to console output (dangerous).

  Use it at you own risk! Calling this function may cause unexpected behavior
  of running console application! That is because function changes console
  contents and cursor position directly, bypassing detouring standard
  ConIn/ConOut processing queue.

  In most cases **safe** functions `Paste`, `Print` and `Keys` are preferable!

  However, with `Write` you may implement some interesting features,
  like printing sort of ‘hints’ in shell prompt:

    Write "\e7\e[90mEcho \"Hello world!\"\e[m\e8"

  Ref: Maximus5/conemu-inside#3

* gh-550, gh-372, gh-234: Unassigned by default hotkey ‘Reset terminal’ (dangerous).

  I'm still sure that this operation is harmful and dangerous:
  <https://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html>.
  But since GuiMacro `Write` exists, anyone may create a macro
  for `Write("\ec")`, which the hotkey actualy executes.

  TabMenu item ‘Edit -> Reset terminal’ is available too.

  BTW, with `Write` macro anyone may push to console several colored lines,
  using ANSI sequences, to ‘mark’ some point in real-time logs (tail -f).

    Write "\n\n\e[91m========== '\e]9;8;\"time\"\e\\' ==========\e[m\n\n"

* Bring here: Just move window to the upper-left corner of active monitor.
* ANSI: Let `ESC ] 9 ; 8 ; "*env*" ST` supports `date` and `time`.


2016.2.17
* gh-541: Chinese translation (from @ulin).
* Maximus5/conemu-inside#4: Don't warn `ConEmu's parent window was terminated abnormally` if we have no VCon.
* Maximus5/conemu-inside#4: Don't show ‘Can't create new virtual console’ error if parent was killed during initialization.
* Maximus5/conemu-inside#12: Query GuiMacro result via callback function.
  ConEmuCD.dll and ConEmuCD64.dll now export `GuiMacro` function.
  https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/commit/ffd3774eb037fb73828ff969464ef57a97dda1a4
* Don't install hooks in `ConEmuC.exe`.
* ConEmuC internal `-echo` able to expand environment variables by `-x` subswitch.
  Example: ConEmuC -echo -x "Version: %ConEmuBuild%"
* Maximus5/conemu-inside#3: Write user-defined text to console on startup.

  Commands `echo` and `type` are processed internally by ConEmuC now.
  For example, it's possible to add into the Settings/Environment.

    echo -x "Welcome to ConEmu %ConEmuBuild% terminal^nPress Win-Alt-P to show Settings dialog"

  Alternatively, you may add `echo` or `type` before the command itself,
  when you create new console, or in the Task definition. Example.

    type -utf8 "%ConEmuDir%\Hello.txt" & cmd /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd"

* Implement `-Args` to show how ConEmu's command line parser works.
  Example: ConEmuC -args "Test1 & ^ "" Test2" "Test "" 3"

* Two double-quotes are replaced with one double-quotes in NextArg.

  So, the command:

    ConEmuC -args "Test1 & ^ "" Test2" "Test "" 3"

  must produce following output:

    1: `Test1 & ^ " Test2`
    2: `Test " 3`

* Changes in `ConEmuC -echo` feature.

  * Arguments are processed one-by-one, strings with special characters
    must be framed with double-quotes, two sequential double-quotes are
    replaces with one double quotes, multiple spaces between arguments
    are treated as single space.

  * If `-r` subswitch is **not** specified, than following replacements are done.

    * `^^` -> `^`
    * `^n` or `^N` -> (char)10 {\n : LF}
    * `^r` or `^R` -> (char)13 {\r : CR}
    * `^t` or `^T` -> (char)9  {\t : TAB}
    * `^a` or `^A` -> (char)7  {BELL}
    * `^b` or `^B` -> (char)8  {\b : BACK}
    * `^e` or `^E` or `^[` -> (char)27  {ESC}

  * If `-x` subswitch **is specified**, than `%EnvVars%` are expanded.

~~~
$ ConEmuC -echo "A1 "" A2"   "A3" A4"
A1 " A2 A3 A4

$ ConEmuC -echo "Line1^nLine2"
Line1
Line2

$ ConEmuC -echo -r "Line1^nLine2"
Line1^nLine2
~~~

* Settings/Environment has priority over console command line.

  Commands `echo`, `type`, `set` and others, defined in on the ‘Environment’
  settings page, are executed before commands, defined in the Task or console
  command line.

  So, if ‘Environment’ has following line

    echo -x "Welcome to the ConEmu %ConEmuBuild% terminal"

  And {cmd} Task is defined like following

    echo "Initializing {cmd} Task..." & cmd /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd"

  Than you'll see in the terminal

    Welcome to the ConEmu 160217 terminal
    Initializing {cmd} Task...

* Log system date on `-log` start and date change.
* Show (StatusBar) and log PID of started console server.
* GuiMacro: `WindowMode("HERE")` moves ConEmu to monitor with mouse cursor.
* Add hotkey for ‘Move ConEmu window to the monitor with mouse cursor (Bring here)’.
* gh-240: Create a workaround for ‘Maximum real console size was reached’.

  Looks like MS-Bug in conhost leads to abnormally large font set in real console,
  if tab was started As Admin in Windows 10 and Win-L pressed.

  > C:\ConEmu\ConEmu64.exe -basic -max -size 12 -visible -log -cmd {cmd (Admin)}
  > rundll32 user32.dll,LockWorkStation


2016.2.11
* Initial steps for localization.
  More information in docs: https://conemu.github.io/en/l10n.html
* gh-539, gh-535: Option ‘Default task for new console’ was ignored (d93b5d9 regression).
* gh-540: In some cases ‘Enhance preudographics’ was skipped.
* Avoid spare RealConsole resize on HideCaption changes.
* Fix broken Far's Editor/Viewer close from TabMenu (7631ffd regression).


2016.2.7
* Alt+HexNumbers: Dump collected codebase to console on ‘invalid’ input or GrayPlus.
* gh-534: Fix wrong background drawing in Far (TrueColor).
* gh-532: ‘Apply’ button failed to return ‘Normal’ mode in ‘Quake’ style.
* gh-78: Rename <Always> to <No-Mod> (modifier for ‘Highlight and goto’ and some others).
  Purpose of this option - process when no modifier (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, ...) is pressed.
* gh-489: Fix TaskBar jump-list problems.
  * Default Tasks for `SDK::VS *` were not created by ConEmu64.exe.
  * Wrong icon was set for tasks `SDK::VS *` in jump-list.
* Default extension (`xml` for example) was not appended if user fails to print it in the ‘Export settings’ dialog.
* Warning fixes (from Michael Lukashov).


2016.2.4
* Support `Alt`-`+`-`HexNumber` input internally, including surrogate pair generation.
  ConEmu is able to convert entered codepoints to surrogate pairs,
  so you may enter uncommon symbols outside from BMP. Examples below.
  * Double-struck ‘𝔸’: press `Alt`-`+`-`1D538`.
  * Sushi emoticon ‘🍣’: press `Alt`-`+`-`1F363`
  More information: https://conemu.github.io/en/AltNumpad.html
* Screen was not updated if shell (cmd for example) was activated back
  from closed Far Manager, if close has been done by cross-click
  and ‘Safe Far Close’ macro.
* gh-524: Deal with entangled window list returned by Far API.


2016.2.2
* New TabMenu items hints (shown in StatusBar when hovering menu with mouse).
* Show confirmation if Shift is pressed when selecting menu items:
  * Kill active process
  * Kill all bat shell
* gh-241: Close consoles refactoring (close Far tabs with single click).
  If Far Manager was started from other shell (from `cmd.exe`, for example)
  than using ‘Safe Far Close’ macro leads to return to the shell prompt,
  instead of termination of this console.
  Also, unchecked option ‘Safe Far Close’ was ignored for `far.exe`.
  In progress actually. We have to simplify close/terminate calls.
* Warn user if automatic action was called without initialized settings.
  The example of command: `ConEmu.exe -SetDefTerm -Detached -MinTSA -Exit`.
  If there is no settings file, user will see FastConfiguration dialog,
  which is unexpected for automatic action (`-SetDefTerm` and `-Exit`).
  If one needs to run ConEmu without settings, they may use `-basic` switch.
* Double-width glyph in the col 1 was cropped in Far editor/viewer.
  For example, if the following text
  中英文Block mode复制初步修复。
  was started from the leftmost console cell,
  than glyph `中` was cropped to one cell.
* GitShowBranch.cmd: Support git branches with dots in branch name.
* gh-515: Internal changes of OnShutdownConsole.
* Add default task {Tools::Docker}.
  Docker is detected by environment variable `%DOCKER_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_PATH%`.
  Also, `bash.exe` (Git, Cygwin or MSys) have to be installed to run `start.sh`.
* Add default task for NYAGOS (if found in %PATH%).
* gh-517: In Quake mode Maximized/Fullscreen was dropped after ConEmu restart.
* conemu-inside/gh-1: Mouse text selection does not work in the Inside mode.
* conemu-inside/gh-4: Avoid crashes when parent process is terminated during startup.
* conemu-inside/gh-4: Correct warning messages and don't show them if parent was terminated during startup.
* Allow to start new tab in current detached instance in one-console mode.
  If option ‘Multiple consoles in one ConEmu window’ is disabled,
  than new console is started in new ConEmu window, but this is impractical
  if there is no consoles in current instance.
  For example: "ConEmu -detached" or existing console was closed.
* Protect from possible ‘locks’ during startup.
* StatusBar column ‘Create new console’ was not updated in some cases.


2016.1.24
* gh#509: Fix crash when checking ‘Explicit executable’.
* Use bare {Far} task name for first `Far.exe` found in our folder.
  To simplify portable and testing installations, if Far Manager
  is copied into our program folder, don't change its task name
  (don't add version/bitness suffixes).
* gh#507: Get rid of MsgBox on attach errors, print info to Console instead.
* gh#514: Fix broken pseudographics representation if ‘Alternative font’ was off.
* Prefer `bash.exe` over `sh.exe` when creating default tasks.
* gd#516: Support ‘Application Cursor Keys (DECCKM)’.
* Update `terminals` module to v0.7.4
* Let characters 0x1F300..0x1F5FF be double-width.
* gh#517: Radio-buttons Maximized and Fullscreen were not working (Apply is required though).


2016.1.11
* Fix bad XML format for GuiMacro GetInfo Root.
* gh#491: Example Far Macro `ConEmu.CtrlShiftT.lua` had wrong hotkey.
* Add ‘Anti-aliasing’ option for alternative font.
* Far Manager was not resized after splitting with Ctrl-Shift-O/E.
  Implement helper ForceFarResize and utilize it in both sync and async modes.
* gh#502, gh#446, gh#447: The algorithm of text drawing has changed significantly.
* Prevent double execution of script specified in "AutoRun" cmd's registry key.
  For example, when "cmd /k CmdInit.cmd" was started (default for {cmd} task)
  triggering `ver` command caused execution of `test.cmd` again.

  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
  "AutoRun"="test.cmd"

* gh#494: Fix clink double initialization.
* connector#3: Let Left/Right/Up/Down/Home/End post sequences `ESC[X`.
* connector#8: Fix `top` output lines.
* Update `terminals` module to v0.7.3.
* Updating progress was not changed during downloading (10% till 99%).
* gh#297: Fix keyboard delay (Windows 7).
* gh#471: Far plugin ‘ConEmu Panel Views’ was broken (da926ba regression).


2015.12.24
* All 64-bit binaries are built with VS14.
  32-bit binaries are still built with VS9 (WinSDK7) to be compatible with old systems.
* gh#486: Use https for github links.
* gh#488: Full paths were shown in Far's editor/viewer tabs (6ce49af regression).
* GuiMacro: Return xml instead of json for `GetInfo Root`.
* API GuiMacro: In-process GuiMacro execution improvements.
  Prototype: int __stdcall ConsoleMain3(int anWorkMode, LPCWSTR asCmdLine)
  Example: ConsoleMain3(3, L" -GuiMacro:1234 Print \"exit\\n\"");
  Note: anWorkMode==3, asCmdLine must begin with space.


2015.12.22
* gh#465: Treat Ctrl-Z as ‘EndOfStream’ in ReadConsole (Go input streams).
  To use, on new line press Ctrl-Z and Enter. Option (Features page) disabled by default.
* gh#469: TabBar/ToolBar is too large.
* gh#473: Support Ctrl+LClick on paths surrounded by brackets.
* connector/gh#4: AltGr+Char was not working with cygwin/msys connector.
* gh#470: Double click word selection was broken.
* conemu-inside/gh#3: New switch `-new_console:c0`.
  It suppress writing to console confirmation messages
  like "Press Enter or Esc to close console...", but let server
  to wait for `Enter` or `Esc` nonetheless.
* ConEmu.Core - Nuget package for Nuget.org, for referencing the stuff from Visual Studio projects.
  Unlike Choco's, this one has to carry all of the payload files inside and not on an URL.
  The nuget with conemu WinForms control references this nuget, so just adding a nuget to your project
  sets it up for using the conemu control out of the box.
* Internal. Fix package name
* API: ConEmuCD exports function ConsoleMain3 to enable ‘in-process’ GuiMacro calls.
  Prototype: int __stdcall ConsoleMain3(int anWorkMode, LPCWSTR asCmdLine)
  Example: ConsoleMain3(0, L"-GuiMacro:1234 Print \"exit\\n\"");


2015.12.17
* AnsiLog was not written properly in some cases.
* Reuse HandleKeeper to determine console handle properties properly
  * ANSI coloring is supported while redirecting text to `CON` from batches.
    Example for cmd prompt: `call cecho "Redirected output" > CON`.
  * Output of msvcrt linked applications, like `PING` or `TRACERT`,
    may be logged (Settings\Features\Log console output).
* gh#461: Fix AeroPeek VCon offset when frame is non-resizable.
* gh#210: Minimizing other windows causes ConEmu to be restored (Quake).
* First try to draw non-spacings/combinings/surrogates/double-width in ‘proper’ size.
  For example, combining accents/umlauts must be shown over preceding letter,
  CJK double-width characters must use two cells to avoid overlapping.
  But that raise some other problems if console application don't care about this.
  For example: Far Manager frames may look corrupted after CJK file names.
* Don't try to pop up console menu by Shift+RClick while LBtn selection is present.
* Make IDM_CLOSE (Tab/Console menu item) behavior more conistent.
  * If menu's opened by RClick on console or by hotkey:
    do ‘Close console’.
  * If menu's opened by TabBar's RClick and it's a group with several tabs:
    do ‘Close tab group’.
  * Otherwise: do ‘Close tab’.
* ConEmu Inside: Terminate our process (ConEmu.exe) if parent window was killed.
* Don't try to hide to TSA in Inside mode.
* gh#467: Startup crash if startup task was renamed.
* Arbitrary shells (not a Task) were not accepted in FastConfiguration dialog.
* Let's save integers as user-friendly 10-based numbers (new xml configs).
* Allow AutoUpdates to ‘Stable’ builds.
* GuiMacro: GetInfo("Root") returns information of current console root process (JSON).
  * If there's no console at all - macro returns either empty string,
    or somthing like "FAILED:Specified ConEmu instance is not found".
  * On errors you may receive `{"Status":"Unknown"}`.
  * Normally, JSON object is expected. Example below, `//` for comments.

~~~
{
"Running": false,  // true or false
"Name": "cmd.exe", // name of root process executable
"PID": 1234,       // PID of root process
"ExitCode": 1,     // 259 if still running, or its exitcode
"UpTime": 12418    // milliseconds
}
~~~

* GuiMacro: Avoid `VConRequired` error macro was received before RCon created.
* GuiMacro: If `ConEmuC -GuiMacro` was started before ConEmu GUI finishes initialization,
  wait for ConEmu window appears or ConEmu.exe process terminates.
* Option ‘Skip click on activation’ was not working on ‘touch’.
* gh#310: Chars entered by Alt+Numpad were not working.
* Warning fixes (from Michael Lukashov).


2015.12.10
* Add batch to build all binaries
* Trim too long console titles in ‘Close confirmation’ dialog.
* Backscroll buffer was not restored after exiting man, vim (608fe12 regression).
* Show internal AppID in the About dialog, log AppID source.
  This ID is used for Win7+ TaskBar (pinned apps).
* In some cases Win7+ pinned TaskBar icon was not reused.
* gh#461: Fix AeroPeek VCon offset when using captionless mode.


2015.12.8
* gh#459: Characters disappear after readline `Ctrl+R`, ..., `Enter`.
* ConEmu Inside: Fix detection of ‘ConEmu has focus’.
* ConEmu Inside: Don't resize VCon or RCon if parent is minimized.
* ConEmu Inside: Show TaskBar progress on parent window.
* ConEmu Inside: Show flashing on parent window.
* Updater. Fight against wininet cache before downloading.
* In some cases ConEmu tried to set abnormally large console size.
* GuiMacro: `GetInfo("ActivePID")` returns PID of active console process or 0.


2015.12.7
* gh#438: No newlines in log files after prompts (cygwin/msys).
  Cygwin/msys shells do not write LF to screen unless they
  were started from ConEmu's cygwin/msys connector.
  Therefore we have to do some magic to ‘detect’ line feeds...
* Update terminals module to v0.7
* In some cases PID of terminal-connector was not shown in the StatusBar.
* Xterm's alternative screen was not cleared on activating.
* gh#351: Allow changing URL for retrieving version location on Settings/Update.
* gh#351: Use `https://conemu.github.io/version.ini` by default.
* Changes in processing of default hotkey `Win+X`.
  * It runs whole task contents, but not only first ‘tab’ from task;
  * If no one task was marked as ‘Default shell’, run default `COMSPEC`
    with arguments ` /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd"`.


2015.12.5
* Show cygwin/msys/clink flags on Settings/Info.
* Post Fxx keys ncurses-friendly in the xterm mode emulation.
* gh#442: In text selection pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` increases selection faster.
  `Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right` jumps by words if possible, or by 10 chars.
  `Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down` jumps by screen halfs.
* gh#455: Redirected output from batch files to `CON` device was not working.
* gh#438: No newlines in log files after prompts.
* Do logging of Far prompt (only screen copy) if ‘Log console output’ is ON.
* Update cygwin/msys connector to v0.6: https://conemu.github.io/en/CygwinMsysConnector.html


2015.12.2
* When ConEmu was started as a child window (InsideParent) it behaves as it has no focus.
* Ensure that all child windows are closed properly on termination (InsideParent).
* Option ‘Activate split/pane on mouse hover’ was not working in InsideParent mode.
* Execution of ‘-GuiMacro:PID’ was failed if ConEmu.exe was in InsideParent.
* Don't allow to execute ‘-GuiMacro:...’ on wrong instance.
* Increase debugger backscroll even if it was started in ConEmu tab.
* XTerm keys fixup (F1..F4, BackSpace, Alt+Char).
* Disable ‘Ctrl+Backspace - delete word leftward to the text cursor’ in cygwin/msys connector.
  Ctrl+BS is posted as "\x1F" and it may be configured in the `.inputrc` as following:
    # Ctrl-BS - kill word on the left
    "\x1F": "\C-w"
* ANSI: Implement `ESC c` - Full reset (clear screen, backscroll, move cursor to the upper-left corner).
* ANSI: Fix errors in `ESC [ *n* @` and `ESC [ *n* P` sequences (insert/delete characters).
* ANSI: Support byobu status line.
* ANSI: Fix extended attributes errors on automatic line scrolling.
* ANSI: Implement `ESC E`, `ESC D`, `ESC M` sequences.
  | ESC E | Same as `\r\n` |
  | ESC D | Same as `\n` but preserves X coord |
  | ESC M | Reverse `\n` |


2015.11.29
* ANSI: Implement (xterm) codes to save `ESC 7` and restore `ESC 8` cursor position.
* ANSI: Sequences `ESC ] ... ESC \` were not processed properly in some cases.
* cygwin/msys connector v0.4
* Warning fixes (from Michael Lukashov)


2015.11.26
* First try to create cygwin/msys terminal connector:
  https://github.com/Maximus5/cygwin-connector/releases/tag/v0.3
* JumpList icon was not created properly for Task in some cases.
  If `/icon` switch was not specified for Task parameters,
  and first line of Task commands started with specials `*` or `>`,
  JumpList icon was not created properly.
* gh#431: Fix crash in EmergencyShow (Win10, closing ConEmu).
* Show in the StatusBar cygwin/msys connector's PID as AltServer.
* Pass UTF-8 encoded strings to debugger (ANSI debug logging).
* ANSI: Implement `ESC [ 3 J`: dispose all backscroll lines (from xterm).
* ANSI: Implement `ESC ] 9 ; 10 ST` - Request xterm keyboard emulation.
* Testing purposes: Options `-a` and `-s` in `ConEmuC -type`.
  `-a` writes text to console using MBCS functions.
  `-s` writes text to console byte-by-byte (streaming).
  Example: `ConEmuC -t -a -s UTF-8-broken.txt`.
* Improve UTF-8 support. In some cases, console output was broken.
* Internal. Reset m_Term on tab restart
* ANSI: Support xterm bracketed paste mode.
  Console application should write `\e[?2004h` to enable and `\e[?2004l`
  to disable bracketed paste mode.
  When mode is enabled, ConEmu sends pasted text to console input buffer
  framed into `\s[200~` ... `\e[201~`.
* ANSI: Long OSC sequences written splitted by writes were processed improperly.
* Don't treat cygwin/msys connector as ‘Incomplete operation’.
* Warnings fixes (from Michael Lukashov).


2015.11.22
* Minhook related: Try to change our imports to ease use of trampolines.
* Append optional switches to single-command tasks.
  For example, there is default task `{cmd}` which has single command:
  `cmd /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd"`.
  Now you may to run `{cmd} /git` from NewConsole dialog or via `-cmd`
  switch of ConEmu.exe. So, the result will be:
  `cmd /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd" /git`.
* ConEmu here: Suggest to start `{cmd}` task instead of bare `cmd` by default.
  * So the default command for ‘ConEmu Here’ will be `{cmd} -cur_console:n`.
    * **Note**. Prepend `/reuse /cmd ` before task name, if you want to reuse
      running ConEmu window: `/reuse /cmd {cmd} -cur_console:n`.
  * Default command for ‘ConEmu Inside will be `{powershell} -cur_console:n`.
* DefTerm. Workaround for some weird command lines (CodeBlocks).
  For example, in CodeBlocks:
  `C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks/cb_console_runner.exe "C:\sources\app.exe"`
  MSDN recommends to quotate paths containing spaces and specials,
  but CB ignores this guideline.
* Try to bypass `start` if `-new_console:z` specified (in `cmd.exe` prompt).


2015.11.19
* gh#412: Failed to restore window position on secondary monitor (d3da351 regression).
* Far Manager plugins ‘ConEmu Background’ and ‘ConEmu Underlines’ were not working on Windows 7.
* First user palette was multiplied on sequental TabMenu calls ‘View (palettes)’.
* On ‘Debug active process...’ always show ‘New console’ dialog.
  So user may run debugger in a split or even change debugger comand line.
* Allow to set hotkeys for debugging menu items.
  * Debug active process (default is `Win+Shift+D`);
  * Active process memory dump;
  * Active process tree memory dump.
* For debugger NewConsole dialog suggest '30%' for split and don't autoselect command.
* Debugger. Switch `/AUTOMINI` will create sequential mini-dumps.
  * So, it may be useful for creating ‘mini snapshots’ of running
  application with specified time intervals.
  After `/AUTOMINI` switch user may specify interval.
  Milliseconds: `/AUTOMINI 500` or `/AUTOMINI 500ms`;
  seconds: `/AUTOMINI 5s`; and minutes: `/AUTOMINI 1m`.
  * Create sequental dumps of 64bit PID=1234 with 500ms interval:
  `ConEmuC64.exe /DEBUGPID=1234 /AUTOMINI 500`
  * Note. Press `Win+Shift+D` (default hotkey) to open NewConsole
  dialog with prefilled command to start debugger on the active
  process in the active console.
* GuiMacro: `Debug(<Action>)` allows to create debugger console or memory dumps.
    Action=0: Debug active process (confirmation dialog with options)
    Action=1: Active process memory dump...
    Action=2: Active process tree memory dump...


2015.11.15
* gh#415: GetLastError returned `6` after WriteFile even on success.
* `Shift`+`Debug active process` allows to run debugger in a split.
  If menu item `Debug active process` is called with `Shift` key pressed,
  NewConsole dialog is opened (allowing to run debugger in a split).
* ConEmuC Debugger. Don't suggest to create MiniDump on MS_VC_THREADNAME_EXCEPTION.
* In some cases ConEmuC64 was started as server for 32-bit root process.
* gh#94: Gray window on PuTTY when connected via local proxy command.
* Correct condition for attaching console app started from ChildGui (from gh#94).
* gh#419: Cygwin-friendly paths were pasted into Clink's prompt.
* Option ‘Suppress bells’ added to ‘Features’ settings page.
  It suppresses annoying bells produced by echoing char(7), Beep
  and MessageBeep functions. ‘Inject ConEmuHk’ is required.
  Instead, ConEmu window (Frame/Title and TaskBar button)
  will flash one time if ‘Disable all flashing’ is not checked.
* Let palettes list (TabMenu) will not be too long.
  There are 25 predefined palettes now, and if user creates
  user-defined palettes, the menu had unhandy scrolling.
* Detection of ‘Active process’ is almost rewritten.
  * Since now, ‘Active process’ is the last process started in console (same as before);
  * But process used to select AppDistinct options must be interactive. For example, you
    have defined AppDistinct settings, with palette `<PowerShell>` for `powershell.exe`
    and palette `<ConEmu>` for `bash.exe` and `git-bash.exe`. Than, palette will not be
    changed anymore when you just run `git status` from powershell's prompt, it will be
    changed if only `bash.exe` is started directly from powershell's prompt.
    That was impelemented to suppress colors flashing during non-interactive command.
* StatusBar column ‘Active process’ shows ‘Interactive’ and ‘Plugin is loaded’.
  * Asterisk `*` after process name: process is reading keyboard input.
  * Sharp `#` after process name: ConEmu plugin is loaded in Far Manager.
* Add ‘ConEmu Underlines’ and ‘ConEmu Background’ items to Far's F11 menu (panels, editor, viewer).


2015.11.9
* Move checkbox `Activate split/pane on mouse hover` to the `Controls` settings page.
* Write process list changes and active process name to log (ConEmu -log).
* Write CtrlC/CtrlBreak and other console events to log (ConEmu -log).
* Don't restart PC without confirmation after `CUP ALL` (chocolatey update).
  https://groups.google.com/d/topic/chocolatey/UvVVLpoBnCg/discussion
* Improve ConEmuC debugger output.

* A lot of ANSI fixes generally for [plink fork](https://github.com/Maximus5/plink#readme).
* ANSI. Primary buffer was not restored properly if there was no backscroll.
* ANSI. Support tmux status line.
* ANSI. Fix some scrolling issues.
* ANSI. Sequence `ESC [ *a* ; *b* r` addresses working area coordinates.
  ANSI aware applications don't know about backscroll (upper invisible area)
  buffer, they intend to work within ‘working area’ instead.
* ANSI. New sequences are supported.

| ESC [ *n* @ | Insert *n* (default 1) blank characters. |
| ESC [ *n* P | Delete *n* (default 1) characters. |
| ESC [ *row* d | Moves the cursor to line *row* (absolute, 1-based). |
| ESC [ 7 m | Use inverse colors |
| ESC [ 27 m | Use normal colors |
| ESC [ ? 47 h | Same as ‘ESC \[ ? 1047 h’ |
| ESC [ ? 47 l | Same as ‘ESC \[ ? 1047 l’ |
| ESC [ ? 1047 h | Activate xterm alternative buffer (no backscroll) |
| ESC [ ? 1047 l | Restore xterm working buffer (with backscroll) |
| ESC [ ? 1048 h | Save cursor position |
| ESC [ ? 1048 l | Restore cursor position |
| ESC [ ? 1049 h | Save cursor position and activate xterm alternative buffer (no backscroll) |
| ESC [ ? 1049 l | Restore cursor position and restore xterm working buffer (with backscroll) |

* ANSI. Report ‘xterm version 136’ on request to avoid problems in Vim,
  accessed by ssh on Unix machines, just let it think it's an xterm terminal.

| ESC [ *>* c | Reports `ESC > 0 ; 136 ; 0 c` |


2015.11.1
* gh#401: Fix: `Ctrl+~` doesn't work on build 151029.

* gh#398: Fix: Taskbar previews don't match tabs order.
* Fix: Win7 taskbar aero peeks appeared in wrong position if pad size was not null.


2015.10.29
* Add `vertical block` marker to clipboard while copying rectangular selection.
  Borland and Microsoft IDE-s are supported.
* Warn if two instances of ConEmu plugin were loaded in Far Manager.
  If due to installation or configuration errors two dll libraries were
  loaded, they both will fail to work properly. So, warn user about the
  problem in detail, show suggestion, and stop plugin initialization.
* Warn user if wrong version of ConEmu plugin was loaded in Far Manager.
* gh#364: Ignore Minimize/Restore hotkeys pressed while Quake animation is not finished.
* Don't try to inject hooks into ConEmuC processes.
* Menu item ‘Active process memory dump’ did not suggested to create dump automatically.
* Add note about maximum length of backscroll buffer (32766 lines).
* Improve configuration detection while reusing running ConEmu instance.
  For example, running `ConEmu -quake` must not create new tab
  in the existing ConEmu ‘non-quake’ instance.
* Some corrections in Single-instance logic.
* Source file codepage was ignored in `ConEmuC -t` switch.
  NB. `ConEmuC /TYPE ...` or its alias `ConEmuC -t ...`
  may be used to type any text file with ANSI sequences.
  Check out full syntax and examples in docs:
  https://conemu.github.io/en/ConEmuC.html#EchoAndType


2015.10.25
* gh#373: Don't decrease window height with AutoTabs (show/hide/show/hide/...)
* gh#388 (gh#295?): Don't change buffer height for cygwin/msys versions of vim.
* gh#359, gh#84: Fix vim color issues on scrolling.
* Don't change buffer height when starting `vim` with `--help` or `--version`.
* Vim terminal mode was not finished properly on exit.

* Checkbox ‘Desktop mode’ was removed from settings.
* gh#336: Don't poll Far 2.x current directories while Editor/Viewer is active.
* gh#17: Send WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE/WM_EXITSIZEMOVE to ChildGui during resize.


2015.10.15
* gh#21: Multi-monitor support improvements.
  * ConEmu takes into account monitor working coordinates when
    using same xml between different PCs.
  * ConEmu tries to guess the monitor where user want to open the window.
  * New `ConEmu.exe` switch `-Monitor <1 | x10001 | "\\.\DISPLAY1">`.
    Where may be specified either monitor 1-based index,
    or HMONITOR (hex descriptor), or monitor name.
    User may check these values in the ‘ConEmu About dialog’
    on then ‘SysInfo’ tab (Win+Alt+A).
* gh#368: Fix thread handles leaks.
* gh#353: Jump lists were created improperly if ConEmu was started with `-single` switch.
* gh#337: Convert pasted paths to cygwin's style if dropping files/folders from Explorer and others.
* On paste filepath by Ctrl+V (Paste first line of clipboard) convert path
  to cygwin style, if active application is cygwin/msys.
* Add `<ConEmu>` color scheme and use it by default (for new configs).
* gh#357: Fix ConEmuHk conflict with python's TKinter dropdown control.
* ANSI: Brightness (back/fore) was not reset in some cases.
  For example: `\e[96mA\e[36mB` - `B` and `A` had same color.
* Implement copying colored text using ANSI sequences.
  The feature works like ‘Copy as HTML’ implemented before.
  Option on the ‘Mark/Copy’ settings page,
  menu item ‘Edit’ -> ‘ANSI sequences’, and GuiMacro(3).
  ConEmu puts to clipboard **real** ESC codes, so only
  certain editors (or shells) are able to **paste**
  these sequences. Far Manager is working nice.
* Only active split was updated after choosing palette from DDCB.
* Improve bCurrentThreadIsMain detection in ConEmuHk (especially for cygwin/msys forks).
* Support ‘Drag&Drop’ from Settings/Colors page onto any place on screen (drag colored square).
* Use v140 toolset for ConEmuHk in ConEmuHk14.vcxproj.
* GuiMacro: `TaskAdd("Name","Commands"[,"GuiArgs"[,Flags]])`.
  Create new task and save it to settings. Example command for
  PowerShell> ConEmuC --% -GuiMacro TaskAdd "Far" @"set ""FARHOME="" & ""%ConEmuDir%\Far\far.exe"" /w /p""%ConEmuDir%\Plugins\ConEmu;%FARHOME%\Plugins"""

* DefTerm. Improve error message, version, process name.
* Temp fix for GetEnvironmentVariable stack overflow.
* Print handles information in `ConEmuC /checkunicode`.
* Fix wrong background from ‘ConEmu Underlines’ in some cases.
  If "Far /e ..." was started from Panels,
  and only ‘Editor’ coloring was enabled in ‘ConEmu Underlines’,
  than wrong background was painted after exit Editor Far.exe process.
* Don't autoclose ConEmu window while error message box is waiting user interaction.
* ConEmuHk termination refactoring.


2015.9.13

* Feature ‘Change prompt position with LClick’ was not working with clink.
* Don't try to position cursor on higher line to avoid numerous beeps (bash, clink, etc.)
* Don't hook Kernelbase.dll in Windows 7 (MultiRunX64 was printed unprocessed ANSI).


2015.9.8
* ConEmuHk. Some internal changes (store function index, fix init/deinit steps).
* gh#279: ConEmu window grew in size after relaunch if size was defined in pixels or percents.
* gh#279: Unchecked ‘Align ConEmu window size to cells’ was ignored on startup.
* Fix unexpected resize to integral size on startup.
* Don't create two default tasks {Bash::Git bash} for `git-cmd.exe` and `bin/sh.exe`.
* Win2k: Remove static link to GetConsoleSelectionInfo.
* Win2k: Adapt ‘Pause’ feature to lack of GetConsoleSelectionInfo.
* gh#216: Mouse wheel only works on first console in split window.
* Don't count `git-cmd.exe` and `git-bash.exe` while checking for ‘Incomplete operations’ during tab/window close.
* Correct close tab/window confirmation message (‘incomplete operations’ was not shown).
* DefTerm. The switch `-new_console:z` was ignored by host application in some cases.
* Print Hex and Dec ExitCode on shell exit errors larger than 255.
* Fix handle leak (GetProcessBits, handle is not freed).


2015.8.21
* Article in wikipedia [was proposed for deletion](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/289).
* Support `/dir %CD%` in Task parameters.
  Than task will be started in the active console working directory.
  [Configure your shell properly](http://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html)
  [Launch task in specific directory](http://conemu.github.io/en/LaunchNewTab.html)
* Task parameter `/dir` was ignored if task was started by `Win+X` hotkey (‘Default shell’ checkbox).
* GuiMacro: Use `ConEmuC -Silent -GuiMacro ..` to suppress GuiMacro result printing.
* gh#287: Fix crashes while starting threads.
* Some internal changes in ConEmuHk.
* Set gcc debug make destination to 'Debug' dir.


2015.8.16

* gh#255, old#1065: Add option ‘Restore to active monitor’ to the ‘Size & Pos’ settings page.
  It moves window to active monitor from inactive by Min/Restore hotkey even if window is visible.
  Option is implied by `-quake` ConEmu.exe switch.


2015.8.14
* Use minhook for hooking. Absolutely different method may eliminate
  a lot of weird problems (import pointers are not changed anymore).
* In some circumstances ConEmu ‘drawing’ almost hangs during mouse text selection.


2015.8.13
* Default task {Shells:cmd-32} to run 32-bit cmd.exe on 64-bit OS.
* Updater. Show in the confirmation message URL of downloaded version.ini.

* Don't load/save `ConInMode` option from settings. There is `-new_console:w[0]` instead.
* Add ZoneId check and unblock for ConEmu's binaries.
  Under some circumstances ConEmu binaries may be marked
  as ‘Downloaded from internet’. That, in turn, may cause
  blocking by SmartScreen or antiviral software.
  ConEmu will do checking of Zone.Identifier NTFS stream
  and warn user if it's found. User may let ConEmu try to
  unblock files automatically or do this themselves.
  More info here: http://conemu.github.io/en/ZoneId.html
* Let default task {cmd} be used for `Win+X` ConEmu hotkey.
  That is the configurable hotkey for ‘Create new ‘cmd.exe’ console’ action.
* gh#224: Try to fix 'Maximum real console size was reached' error.
* DefTerm. Add ‘Apply’ button to settings page.
* DefTerm. Add option to log all ‘exec’ activities of hooked processes (debug purposes).

2015.7.28
* Updater. Show user-friendly information download fails, add ‘Retry’ button in the error dialog.
* Issue 1899: Java 7 has been crashed with java.lang.InternalError.
  If Java.exe was executed from symlinked location, the exception
  was occurred in some circumstances:
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.InternalError: Should not get here
  at sun.nio.fs.WindowsNativeDispatcher.GetFinalPathNameByHandle(Native Method)


2015.7.27

* Write to Log information about used storage location (xml-file/reg + config).
* For debugging purposes SEH is disabled in this release.


2015.7.16
[!] Now user may use any external downloader tool if ConEmu's internal does not suite.
[*] Implement new switch `-update` to force automatic update procedure.
[*] Describe switch `-LoadRegistry` in ConEmu's About dialog.
[*] Force Win7 TaskBar to use different taskbar buttons for different configs
    selected by one of the following switches:
    `-config <name>`, `-loadcfgfile <file>`, `-loadregistry`, `-basic`.
[*] Allow to delete several tasks at once, just select them with Shift or Ctrl pressed.
[*] Button ‘Add default tasks’ behavior was changed. Confirmation dialog suggests to
    either to add absent tasks or add and recreate all default tasks.
    Recreation will affect tasks' commands and parameters.
[*] gh#213: Improve update error reporting, more logging.
[*] Switch processor refactoring (code moved to CConEmuStart class).
[*] Internal changes in threads creating/killing.
[*] Some more logging for toolbar buttons and window resizing.


2015.7.7
[*] This build changes the download procedure used within automatic updates.
    ConEmu.exe (GUI) do not call WinInet functions anymore, instead it calls
    the downloader tool (ConEmuC.exe is an only option at the moment).
    This will eliminate accidental crashes of GUI after resume from sleep.
[*] The downloader itself has new options.
    If user omit dst file name - try to get it from Url.
    If "-" was specified as dst file name or output is redirected - just write contents to stdout.
    New switch ‘-agent <name>’ was implemented.


2015.7.5
[*] Script "ConEmu/GitShowBranch.cmd" was improved.
[*] Highlight & goto was broken at least for powershell scripts (c8c386a regression).
    Only file name (path) was highlighted without following line number.
[*] Highlight & goto detector was failed if mouse was before first backslash of the path.
[*] gh#205: TabBar was not shown on startup in some monitor configurations (bacc66d regression).


2015.7.1
[*] Add optional ‘/Silent’ switch to suppress environment exporting messages.
    ConEmuC [/SILENT] /EXPORT[=CON|GUI|ALL] [Var1 [Var2 [...]]]
[*] gh#193: Fix wrong condition: ‘Warn if MacType hookers are loaded’.
[*] Omit ConEmuC export variables message in GitShowBranch.cmd.
[*] gh#174: Let paste to all ‘grouped input’ consoles at once.
[*] Show actual hotkey instead of default Ctrl+BackSpace in Settings.
[*] Vert/Horz text cursor was displayed in wrong position especially on DBCS systems.
[*] Ctrl+BackSpace feature was not working on DBCS systems.
[*] Redirect chocolatey downloads to github.
[*] gh#204: ConEmu hung on startup in some cases while initializing default tasks.


2015.6.29
[*] Attach (Win+G) was not succeeded if ConEmu has different bitness.
[*] Grab palette from Win+G attached consoles (Vista+) and create new
    if matching one was not found. These palettes ‘#Attached:XX’ are not
    saved automatically, but will be when user presses ‘Save settings’ button
    in the settings dialog.
[*] gh#193: Show hookers warning once per day.
[*] Show real names for ‘Win+Number’ and ‘Win+Arrows’ on the Controls page.
[*] Search for static text control in the Settings dialog was failed.
[*] Issue 1977: Don't change RealConsole height on tabs auto-show/hide,
    resize ConEmu window height instead.
[*] Add some urls to ConEmu.nuspec (chocolatey).
[*] When tabs are auto shown icon was not loaded for the first tab.
[*] Environment variables export was improved (some internal fixes).


2015.6.21
[*] Use recommended launcher for Git-For-Windows bash (default tasks).
[*] Try to create default task for GitSDK bash.
[*] Let Settings\Environment page use one line for one command.

    This will make concrete set commands with quotation marks.
    Following two commands are equal.

      set "PATH=C:\Program Files\ConEmu;%PATH%"
      set PATH=C:\Program Files\ConEmu;%PATH%

    But you still have to use quotations to keep trailing spaces

      set "VarName=This is my value   "

[*] Support empty lines and comments on the Settings\Environment page.
    You may comment lines with '#', '//', '--' or 'REM '.
[*] gh187: Highlight and goto did not work when filename not finished by :[space] or :[number].
[*] Improve default task names unification and sorting.
[*] The arrow char was inserted into Far Manager prompt after selecting text with Alt+Mouse.
[*] Fix xml search path for Git-For-Windows package.
    Correct one is /opt/share/conemu/ConEmu.xml while ConEmu.exe is placed
    in /opt/bin folder.
[*] Error code was not shown properly if DefTerm inject fails.


2015.6.10
[*] Simplify `set` usage in Settings\Environment.
[*] gh#179: Fix broken environment inheritance (ca9e31a regression).
[*] Ensure that `set` commands in the task/command line will override ConEmu's default environment (settings page).
[*] GuiMacro: Make Task and Shell functions synchronous to be able to use Context function after it.
[*] GuiMacro: Return more information about wrong macro.
[*] GuiMacro: Easify calling functions with int arguments. "Sleep 500;" was not working.
[*] GuiMacro: Sleep function have not returned "OK" on success.
[*] Allow using `-new_console` and `-cur_console` switches to set DosKey aliases.
[*] Support aliases set up on the ConEmu Settings/Environment page.

    Note! These console aliases are processed by `cmd.exe` and `far.exe` only.
    If you need to set up aliases for other shells (PowerShell, bash, etc.)
    please refer to their manuals.

    Defining aliases are similar to `doskey.exe`. Actually, you may define:

      alias alias=doskey $*

    After that you can use `alias` in the `cmd.exe` prompt started in ConEmu:

      alias sudo=ConEmuC -c $* -new_console:an

    That is just an example. It's more handy to add `sudo` definition into
    ConEmu Settings/Environment page.
    And when `sudo` is defined you may run from `cmd.exe` prompt, for example:

      sudo diskpart

[*] gh#176: Avoid creating two tabs while starting "git-bash.exe --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i".

    However, preferred way to start Git-For-Windows in ConEmu tab is:

      git-cmd.exe --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i

[*] Update ConEmuPortable.ini with Environment information.


2015.6.8
[*] Quake mode enabled by `-quake` command line switch was not shown in Fast Configuration dialog.
[*] Suggest the task user specified by `ConEmu.exe -cmd {cmd}` in Fast Configuration dialog.
[*] Don't set default task in Fast Configuration dialog, use exact `-cmd ...` command specified by user.
[*] gh#151: Do (quake) animation after starting RealConsole creation.
[*] Add `-here` switch description in the About dialog.
[*] Ensure all default bash tasks names will be unique.
[*] Always reset FARHOME env.var when creating default Far tasks.
[*] Move checkboxes ‘Add ConEmu??? to PATH’ to separate page ‘Environment’.
[*] gh#171, Issue 1655: Add option to skip ‘... brought ConEmu OnTop. Revert?’ confirmation.
[*] gh#173: Attach of detached console ignored new ConEmu instance.
[*] gh#173: Implement Unfasten of console tabs (ChildGui not yet). Tab menu item, hotkey and GuiMacro.
[*] Implement ‘Settings\Environment’ page.
    User may define here multiple "set varname=varvalue" commands
    or set default console code page with "chcp utf-8", "chcp 866" and so on.
    Environment %variables% in 'varvalue' are allowed and would be expanded before do set.
    One line - one command (set or chcp).
[*] Create folder "ConEmu\Scripts" by installer.
    May be useful for storing user scripts (bat-files and so on).
    It would/may be added to PATH in the Settings\Environment page.
[*] Git-For-Windows: Search for xml in /share/conemu while ConEmu.exe is intended to be in /opt/bin.
[*] Log and warn (debug assertion) long alternative buffer loading.
[*] Many MINGW-build related fixes from @Alexpux.


2015.5.13
[*] Don't show [reg] or [xml] in Fast Configuration dialog because there is the storage location field.
[*] gh#142: Win+Left/Right didn't snap window if it was maximized.
[*] gh#139: If Quake was hidden when user presses Win key (Start menu), ConEmu was unexpectedly slided down after second Win press (after menu was hidden).
[*] Garbage was shown sometimes while searching in Settings dialog.
[*] gh#143: Add CygWin bash default tasks by checking registry (for new config).
[*] RealConsole pause refactoring.
[*] Execute RedrawWindow in the server process to avoid access violation.


2015.5.4
[*] Jump list command was built erroneously if there was ‘-FontDir ...’ or some other switch.
[*] The field ‘Startup task’ was not filled in the ConEmu Fast Configuration dialog.
[*] Fix ChocolateyAbout.cmd script, correct PATH suggestion and powershell command.
[*] Check if Chocolatey is already installed and show the path (ChocolateyAbout.cmd).
[*] gh#127: ConEmu did not stay minimized if a new console tab was opened in background.
[*] gh#106: ChildGui turned black after ConEmu was restored.


2015.4.28
[*] Reset `FARHOME` env.var when creating default {Far} task without full path to `far.exe`.
[*] Default/startup task may be not initialized properly if saved config was partial.
[*] Show proper error code in StatusBar if restart console was failed.
[*] gh#121: Selecting 'No' when restarting console as admin produced error state.


2015.4.27
[*] gh#112: Python with Tk: rightclick menu window not showing.
[*] Set `FARHOME` env.var in default created Far tasks.
    That is because otherwise FARHOME may hold wrong value

    ConEmu was switched to "%USERPROFILE%". That's because these folders may be used
    if user starts ConEmu (or just cmd as DefTerm) from bare Win+R.

2015.2.6
[*] CP hack: Use ConEmuCpCvt to force output CP conversion.
    If some command uses wrong CP while converting ANSI to Unicode
    (the example may be perl.exe from "git add -p")
    set variable to correct its output. Use asterisk for all apps.
    This hack affects ONLY WriteConsoleW function calls.
    Format:
      <exename>:<badcp>:<goodcp>[;<exename>:<badcp>:<goodcp>[...]]
    Example:
      set ConEmuCpCvt=perl.exe:1252:1251;*:850:866;
[*] CP hack: Use ConEmuDefaultCp to change output CP if you don't want to use chcp.
    If you can't use "chcp <codepage>" to change whole console CP output,
    you may change it using environment variable ConEmuDefaultCp.
    It will affect only WriteFile and WriteConsoleA functions.
    So, if you need to run several apps in one console simultaneously...
      set ConEmuDefaultCp=1251
      ConEmuC -fork -c App1.exe
      set ConEmuDefaultCp=866
      ConEmuC -fork -c App2.exe
      set ConEmuDefaultCp=

[*] Tasks may be organized with folders. Delimit task name from folder name with "::".
    For example, type "Shells::PowerShell" instead of "PowerShell", and so on.
    Only one level of folders is allowed. No need to reorder tasks of one folder
    continuously, folders are filled by name. Generally this was implemented for
    drop-down `[+]` menu.
[*] Create default tasks with folders (Shells, Bash, SDK, and so on).
[*] Find task by name with or without folder part (Startup page).
[*] Button 'Add default tasks' will not create task duplicates (checking by task name).
[*] Allow switch '/reuse' in task parameters (alias for '/single' yet).


2015.2.3

[*] github#20: ‘Ctrl-Left’ and ‘Ctrl-Right’ was not working in Vim/xterm.
[*] Create new console confirmation now if disabled by default.
    So ‘Win+W’ or ‘LClick’ on the `[+]` button creates new default task.
    The default task may be choosed in the ‘Tasks’ settings page.
    New console dialog (command, directory, as admin, and so on)
    may be shown with:
    * ‘Win+Shift+W’;
    * ‘Shift+LClick’, ‘RClick’ or ‘LongTap’ on the `[+]`;
    * ‘New console dialog...’ menu item (down arrow about `[+]`).
[*] Window and tab closing confirmations now are disabled by default.
    But if there are more than a two user processes running in the console -
    close confirmation may be shown. So, there are thee checkboxes now:
    * Confirm window closing (unchecked);
    * Confirm tab closing (unchecked);
    * When running process was detected (checked).

[*] Status ‘Console server started...’ sometimes was not cleared on startup.
[*] DefTerm. Feature was rewritten almost from scratch.
    * For accessibility reasons DefTerm settings are mirrored in registry [HKCU\Software\ConEmu].
      That means, for example, user may change ‘DefTerm-Enabled’ value to 0 to disable feature
      any time, even if ConEmu is not running at the moment.
    * Save to registry only from Settings window (DefTerm page clicks) or ConEmu startup (if DefTerm is enabled).
    * Update status bar during DefTerm installation.
    * It is possible to hook processes by their window class name.
    * New ‘Agressive’ mode of DefTerm hooking.
      Sample usecase:
      The `explorer.exe` was hooked (for example with ‘Register on OS startup’ option),
      when you start new `devenv.exe`, started process will be hooked from `explorer.exe`,
      even if you have not have ConEmu loaded at the moment of `devenv.exe` start.
    * Allow windowless ‘Register on OS startup’.
    * Server startup fails sometimes if console window was hidden.
    * Seamless startup from VC# debugger, no RealConsole flickering.
    * Many internal changes.

[*] Do not show ‘Starting attach autorun’ for default terminal consoles (cmd as Admin).
[*] Speed up xml load/save.
[*] Issue 1611: GuiMacro. Optional <IsRelative> argument in SetOption function.
    Set IsRelative=1 to use relative instead of absolute for some options,

2014.06.02
[*] Issue1598: When reopening Settings dialog, show last selected section.

    * New predefined (available in list) editor command lines for Vim, SciTE, Notepad++ and Sublime.
    * Prefix ‘#’ means ‘run editor outside of ConEmu tab’.

    * Force run specified external editor instead of open file in the existing Far instance.
[*] GitHub#13: Was unable to save 'Highlight and goto' modifier.
[*] Issue1596: Rust-compiled apps were crashed in ConEmu.
[*] Use ‘PATH’ defined in the ‘App Paths’ registry key if running application without full path.
[*] Internal. Do not turn on session.SetSessionNotification on startup.


2014.05.29

[%] Wrong startup directory used when starting at the drive root.
[+] Allow rename any Far tab, not only panels.

[%] Fix panel tab title blinking during edit/view opening.
[%] Issue 436: Do not lose recent tab (editor/viewer) history after cmd execution from Far.


2014.05.05
[!] Limited logging of console contents.
    Option ‘Inject ConEmuHk’ must be enabled to get that feature!
    Only ‘Standard output’ will be logged (the same activity as processed
    with ‘ANSI X3.64’ processor). So, certain Windows console API functions
    will not be logged (Far Manager panels, for example).
    You may choose folder for storing log-files, default is "%ConEmuDir%\Logs\".
    Note! Default folder may be write-protected, if you've installed
    ConEmu to "Program Files". So, you may need to choose write-enabled
    folder.
    Each console will share its own log-file, example: "ConEmu-YYYY-MM-DD-pPID.log".
    So, if several processes will write to console output simultaneously,
    you may get unpredictable result in your log-file.
    By default, logging is disabled.
[%] ANSI. Fix ‘no-color’ on new line.
[%] ANSI. Fix ‘bad color cell’ on EOL.
[*] ANSI. Do not break "\r\n" in two physical writes.

[%] github#5: Console was not started as admin when ‘Create new console’ dialog was skipped.
[*] Don't hide row/col highlight on focus loose.
[%] Issue 1557: Switch -new_console:u:"other_user:password" may lock the account of other_user.
    In some cases starting new console without directly specified
    working directory (with -cur_console:d:... for example) may lock
    other_user account with reason ‘Bad password count exceeded’.
[*] Issue 1516: ConEmu fails to duplicate root when cmd.exe was catched as ‘Default terminal’.


2014.04.22
[+] GuiMacro. Sleep(Milliseconds).
    Because it is processed inside GUI process, Milliseconds are limited to 10000 (10 sec) max.
[+] GuiMacro. Break() for Ctrl+C and Break(1) for Ctrl+Break.
    However, these function may fails in some cases (in RealConsole for example).
    Also, they are processed by Windows asynchronously, so you may need
    to Sleep(ms) after them if your want to print("something") to console after.
[%] Clipboard use optimization - RClick Paste may fails sometimes.
[%] Fix hyperlinks underlining errors (c31f3cb regression).


2014.04.16

[*] Issue 1532: Show only critical status messages in the top-left terminal corner.
[*] Issue 1534: Use About() and Settings() GuiMacro for system hotkeys (Win+Alt+A, Win+Alt+P, Win+Alt+K)
    System hotkeys are fixed by design. But user can use GuiMacro
    to open About or Settings dialogs. Moreover, if you need to open
    dialogs with special page activated (if you need some page often).
[*] Add ConEmuEnvironment#Export_variables link to About dialog (Console tab).
[*] Issue 1546: Mark/copy with mouse appears very slow in some cases.


2014.04.04

    For example, you are running task with '/icon nice.ico' in Task parameters.
    You may reset it in task commands if you are running several tabs at once:
      cmd -new_console:C:
      powershell -new_console:C:twice.ico
[*] Hook mouse_event and SendInput API.
[*] Allow '/icon' task parameter to change tab icon too.
[*] Restrict '/icon' task parameter to change already started instance window icon.

    Actually, not only spaces are taken to account: >])}$.,/\"
[*] About dialog '-new_console' fixes.
[*] No need to unset hooks if our process is to be force killed by TerminateProcess (minor speed up).

      /bufferheight <lines>
      /dir <workingdir>
      /icon <tabicon>
      /tab <tabtitle>

    Till now LoadLibrary will be hooked in:
      a) Windows2k, WindowsXP - all processes
      b) Far Manager (far.exe, far32.exe, far64.exe)
[*] Vim xterm arrow key lags happen sometimes.
    When Vim was switched to xterm mode, ConEmu sends corresponding
    xterm ESC-sequences instead of simple VK_xxx keypresses.
    Sometimes Vim don't catch whole sequence before any other event
    occures. For example, you press Right arrow and Vim does nothing
    before you just move mouse over console.
[*] Issue1511. Url was not detected after 'port': http://example:8080/TestTest/test?test=test
[*] Issue1516. Duplicate root failed for consoles started from TaskMgr via Default terminal feature.
[*] Consider console is to be started hidden if start X/Y==32767 (Hooks).
[*] Tooltip msg fix.
[*] Quake settings. Name 'Cascade' as 'Centered', enable 'Apply' on change.
[*] New option 'Retard inactive panes' on Features page.
    There is already 'Sleep in background' option which retard ConEmu window and
    its tabs when ConEmu is minimized/inactive.
    New option 'Retard inactive panes', disabled by default, retard inactive
    but visible split-panes in the active ConEmu window.

2014.03.02
[%] Regression 131211. (Issue 158) ConEmu PanelView was not updated after panel change.
[+] Internal. AnsiDebugger added to src folder.

[%] Wheel over inactive mintty pane unexpectedly scrolls active pane below too.


2014.02.27
[*] Don't unlock working directory until ConEmu initialization finished.
    So, behavior of "-loadcfgfile" and "-savecfgfile" changed. If you

2014.02.25
[*] Log Lock/Unlock/Logoff events.
[*] GuiMacro. Keys("Combo1"[,"Combo2"[,...]])
    Combo syntax is mostly similar to AutoHotKey syntax: [Mod1[Mod2[Mod3]]]Key
    Where ‘Mod’ may be: ^ - LCtrl, >^ - RCtrl, ! - LAlt, >! - RAlt, + - Shift.
    For example, if you want to ‘Ctrl+/’ post ‘Ctrl+_’ - use macro: Keys("^_").
[*] Support "\b", "\xFF" and "\xFFFF" in GuiMacro strings.
    Hexadecimal parser stops on first NON hexadecimal character. So, avoid ambiguous
    strings like "\x05five", this will be parsed as two strings "\x05f" and "ive"
[*] Support more that one string argument in Paste and Print GuiMacro functions
    Paste (<Cmd>[,"<Text>"[,"<Text2>"[...]]])

2014.02.03
[*] Vim fails to react for window size change in the xterm terminal mode.


2014.02.02
[+] New ‘Intelligent selection’ mode.
    Now, you may start both block or text selection with mouse without modifier pressed.
    Type of selection will be determined by the direction of LButton mouse drag,
    when you start drag vertically - block selection, horizontally - text selection.
    If you set up and press selection modifier - mouse selection will start even
    if ‘Intelligent selection’ is disabled with exceptions.
    New mode may be disabled ‘totally’ or for specified processes only.
    For example, Vim knows about text selection and can process mouse internally,
    and Far Manager can use mouse for dragging files or text selection in Editors.
    When "far" specified in the exceptions without extension, you can use new mode
    in the ‘User screen’ (panels are off) and in Viewers.
[*] So, ‘Mark/Copy’ settings page redesigned
[*] GuiMacro. Paste(9), Paste(10) - One-line paste with or without confirmation.
[*] ‘Change prompt position with LClick’ works on left button release.

[!] Experimental! ConEmu may set up itself as default terminal for console applications.

    Warning! Autoupdate with 7z package may fails if this feature is enabled!
    Settings -> Integration -> Force ConEmu...
    Note! In the current build active ConEmu window required for processing interception.
    TechInfo: When enabling this feature ConEmu calls CreateRemoteThread for injecting
    ConEmuHk.dll into selected processes (explorer.exe by default). This allows to
    intercept CreateProcess WinAPI function and replace it with ConEmu.exe...
    There is new ConEmu.exe switch "/nodefterm" - don't start initialization procedure.
[%] Issue 825: ANSI X3.64 sequences don't works with Gow ls.

    set ConEmuReportExe=sh.exe
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\sh.exe" --login -i

    when creating new console. For example, you may start gvim from cmd running in ConEmu:
	gvim --windowid !ConEmuBackHWND! -new_console:sH


2012.11.06
[+] New ConEmuC command: Export environment variables to parent processes.

    History buffer size - min=16, default=50; Count - min=16, default=32.

    get submenu with task contents. You may click task command to start particular command.

[+] Доработана вкладка ‘Integration’.
    Группы ‘ConEmu Inside’ и ‘ConEmu Here’ отвечают за регистрацию/удаление пунктов контекстного
    меню проводника для дисков/папок/файлов. Выпадающие списки ‘Menu item’ показывют текущие
    пункты меню (то что сейчас зарегистрировано в реестре).
    Любой пункт можно просмотреть (выбрав его в списке) и отредактировать (нажав кнопку ‘Register’).
    Группа ‘Automatic attach of cmd...’ позволяет установить (или просмотреть текущую) команду,
    выполняемую процессором (cmd и tcc) при старте. Это позволяет автоматически подцепить запущенный
    cmd/tcc в новую вкладку ConEmu.


2012.07.05
[!] Settings tree redesigned.
[%] Issue 630: ‘Snap to desktop edges’ and multi-monitor layout.
[+] ConEmuC: "/ATTACH /CONPID=<pid> /GHWND=NEW" - Alternative nonintrusive attach of existing console to the NEW instance of ConEmu.exe.
[%] Issue 623: Continue...


2012.07.04
[%] FindEditor/FindViewer/FindFarWindow возвращал "NotFound".
[%] На вкладке Debug создавались ‘пустые’ строки даже при ‘Shell activity’ = ‘Disabled’.
[*] Issue 623: Continue...

[+] Alternative nonintrusive attach mode for console windows.


2012.07.03
[+] Now DoubleClick (for ‘words’) and TripleClick (for ‘lines’) both works for text selection.
[+] Расширены ANSI коды (ESC ] 9 ; ...) - http://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ConEmu_specific_OSC.
[*] Issue 623: Checking...


2012.07.02
[+] Drag window by any point of client area (configurable modifier, Ctrl+Alt by default).
[+] ‘Features’ -> ‘Snap to desktop edges’.
[%] Issue 626: /dir arg is ignored for startup task.
[+] ‘Colors’ -> Text/Back. The beginning.


2012.07.01
[+] Для облегчения отладки и сообщений об ошибках.
    Создать mini-dump: ConEmuC.exe /DEBUGPID=<PID> /MINI
    Создать full-dump: ConEmuC.exe /DEBUGPID=<PID> /FULL
    О соответствии битности беспокоиться не нужно, все сделает сам ConEmuC.exe.
    Также, добавлен пункт в системном меню ConEmu: Debug -> Active process memory dump.
[+] Tasks: /DIR "<dir>" учитывается при запуске вкладки в уже открытом ConEmu.
[+] Также, рабочую папку можно указать с помощью параметров "-new_console:d[:<dir>]" и "-cur_console:d[:<dir>]".
[*] Немного AI в 'Change prompt text cursor position with Left Click' - не пытаться вывести курсор за пределы строки.
[+] Issue 575: Confirm or abort setting ConEmu OnTop from external program.


2012.06.30
[+] Page 'Transparency', 'Use separate value'.
[%] После закрытия консоли (не последней) на статусной строке не обновлялось поле 'ActiveCon/TotalCount'.
[*] ConEmu inside mode.
    Синхронизация текущей папки: Explorer -> ConEmu. На статусной строке добавлена кликабельная колонка 'Sync'.
    Адаптировано для Vista.
[+] More ANSI examples. RenameTab.cmd, SetConTitle.cmd, SetProgress.cmd.
[+] GuiMacro: Progress(<Type>[,<Value>])
	Set progress state on taskbar and ConEmu title.
	 Type=0: remove progress.
	 Type=1: set progress value to <Value> (0-100).
	 Type=2: set error state in progress.
[+] На ярлык ConEmu (или сам ConEmu.exe в проводнике) можно набросить один или несколько ярлыков программ.
    Каждая запустится в своей вкладке.
    Исключение - если в в настройке ConEmu "Startup" -> "Command line" указан "far.exe". В этом
    случае строка запуска "подклеивается" к "far.exe".
[+] При быстром закрытии ConEmu "крестиком" в консоли успевало мелькнуть "Press Enter or Esc to close console...".
[+] Issue 575: Confirm or abort setting ConEmu OnTop from external program.
[%] Issue 624: Menu was not available in Notepad++ with SourceCookifier plugin.


2012.06.26

2012.06.25
[+] Новая опция 'Min cursor size (pix)' на вкладках 'Text cursor' & 'App distinct'.
[%] Issue 619: В не которых случаях возникал Assertion после закрытия Far Manager.
[*] Немного поправим 'Detect text line ends', 'Trim trailing spaces', 'Bash margin'.
[+] Новый ключик для ConEmu.exe - "/inside". Пример использования в "ConEmu\Addons\ConEmu_Inside.reg".
    Смысл - создать панель в проводнике и запустить в ней, например, powershell.
    Пока ‘на поиграться’, вроде работает в Windows 7 и Windows 8, в других системах не проверял.
    Перед вызовом контекстного меню в проводнике нужно либо увеличить высоту нижней области (Windows 7),
    либо показать панель информации/просмотра (Windows 7 & 8).


2012.06.24
[*] На вкладке 'Mark & Paste' опция 'Auto copy' переименована в 'Copy on LButton up'. По умолчанию включена.
[%] Не сохранялось значение флажка 'Highlight and goto' и пути 'External editor'.
[*] Isue 587, Issue 605: При Paste не показывать сообщение об отсутствии текста в буфере обмена.
[+] Настройка времени появления/скрытия полосы прокрутки.
[+] Еще про Quake: настройка 'окантовки' вокруг консоли 'Pad size (pix)', работает только при включенном 'Try to center'.
[+] 'App distinct' settings page redesigned.
[*] Теперь могут быть изменены комбинации: Apps+Space, Alt+F9, Alt+Enter, Alt+Space, Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Down, Ctrl+PgUp, Ctrl+PgDn и PicView.SlideShow.
[*] Соответственно, убраны флажки из 'Send to console': Alt+F9, Alt+Enter, Alt+Space.
[%] Win+Down не увеличивал размер консоли (опция ‘Win+Arrows - resize window’).
[%] Issue 606: На Windows XP не появлялось сообщение (тултип) об ошибках в области нотификаций (TSA).
[*] Настройки текстового курсора перенесены на новую отдельную вкладку 'Text cursor'.
[+] Issue 612: Option to change cursor size ('Fixed cursor size' & '(5-100) %').
[%] Issue 608: Проблемы с telnet.
[*] cmd/powershell/tcc: Параметр "-new_console" (для запуска консольных приложений в новом табе) теперь можно использовать в prompt без "ConEmuC.exe".
    Например, в cmd prompt можно ввести: powershell -new_console
[%] Исправлен Detach GUI приложений.
[+] Issue 607: 'Mark & Paste' and 'App distinct' -> 'Detect text line ends', 'Bash margin', 'Trim trailing spaces', 'EOL'.
[+] 'Mark & Paste' and 'App distinct' -> 'Change prompt text cursor position with Left Click'.

[+] Issue 582: Позиционирование текстового курсора кликом мышки в prompt (cmd, powershell, tcc/le, ...)


2012.06.17a
[%] Задержка при активации ConEmu с открытым Far 3.
[%] В Putty не проходили события от колеса мышки.
[%] В 120617 поломался аттач GUI приложений.


2012.06.17
[+] 'Quake style slide down' third state - auto hide on lose focus.
[%] Не перехватывать фокус при запуске, если запускаемся с ключом "/min".
[+] Issue 599: 'Auto copy' on 'Mark & Paste' - copy selected text immediately on left mouse button up (when selecting with mouse).
[%] Issue 599, Issue 570: Small lags removed, when pastings long text from clipboard.
[+] 'Main' settings page redesigned.
[+] Chinese improvments.
[*] Some Wine related fixes, but still not working ;)
[*] При невозможности зарегистрировать глобальный хоткей (Minimize/Restore) выдается сообщение в области уведомлений.
[*] Умолчание для Minimize/Restore - Win+Shift+C.


2012.06.14
[+] Для фоновой картинки добавлены опции DownLeft и DownRight.
[%] Issue 577: Chinese font display error on Chinese Win XP.
[%] Issue 587: Right click gives an error box.


2012.06.13
[%] При удалении задачи, назначенной в Startup, ConEmu переставал запускаться.
[%] 120612: При выполнении команды с "-new_console" ConEmu минимизировался.
[+] Меню таба (Rename tab) и Apps+R - переименовать активный таб. Для Far - пока можно переименовать только ‘Панели’.
[+] Для фоновой картинки добавлена опция UpRight.
[%] Issue 590: Изменена обработка Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break.
[*] Some Quake style improvements.


2012.06.12
[+] В поставку добавлен пример ‘ColorPrompt.cmd’. Запустите его в cmd.exe или tcc.exe
    для смены цвета текста command prompt на желтый.
[+] Новые аргументы для ConEmu.exe - /ShowHide и /ShowHideTSA.
    Если ConEmu не запущено - запускает (с возможно указанным /cmd ...),
    если окно ConEmu уже открыто - сворачивает его или прячет в TSA.
    Действие похоже на глобально регистрируемый хоткей (Win+C), но этот хоткей не работает,
    если ConEmu не был запущен. А с ключами - можно настроить ярлык на рабочем столе.
[+] Аргумент ConEmu.exe: /dir "Folder". Аналог Working folder, задаваемый в свойствах ярлыка.
[+] Параметр ‘Quake style slide down’ на вкладке ‘Features’.
    Пример настройки в ‘ConEmu\ConEmu_Tilda.xml’.
    Если вы хотите что-то типа этого
    http://tech-bytes.co.uk/2008/05/23/a-quake-style-console-for-your-gnome-desktop/
    переименуйте ‘ConEmu_Tilde.xml’ в ‘ConEmu.xml’,
    при загрузке компьютера запустите !ConEmu с ключом /min,
    и вы получите ‘выезжающую’ консоль по тильде.
[%] Issue 576: Trap when updating Jump Lists/Task while history is empty.
[%] Не работал Copy из альтернативной консоли (Win+A).
[%] Issue 584: App distinct color palette not working.
[%] Issue 576: ConEmu.exe /updatejumplist.
[%] When Maximized, check/uncheck ‘Hide caption always’ losed caption.

    Paste(3[,"<Text>"]) - paste first line, without confirmations
    Task(Index) - start task with 1-based index
    Task("Name") - start task with specified name
[+] В диалоге настроек для GuiMacro (вкладка Keys) работают "\\", "\r", "\n", "\t".
    Теперь можно задать что-то вроде ‘Paste(2,"exit\n")’ для выхода из cmd.exe


2012.06.09
[%] Коррекция Injects для Windows 8 RC.
[+] Issue 571: В диалоге подтверждения создания консоли добавлен флажок ‘New window’.
    Если указывается ‘Another user’, то под выбранным аккаунтом запускается сам ConEmu.exe.
    При желании, можно назначить отдельный хоткей для открытия диалога с включенным флажком.
[%] В некоторых случаях по краям консоли оставался мусор.
[*] Уточнение снятия скриншотов (режимы Maximized/Fullscreen).
[%] Не работал Attach GUI приложений.
[%] При перемещении мышкой бегунка полосы прокрутки - не обновлялось положение курсора.


2012.06.08

[+] GuiMacro: WindowFullscreen, WindowMaximize, WindowMode, Status.
[+] Keys: Always on Top, Show/hide status bar (Apps+S), Show/hide tab bar (Apps+T), About (Win+Alt+A).
[+] About: В диалог добавлены вкладки с информацией по параметрам ConEmuC, -new_console и GuiMacro.
[+] На вкладке ‘Mark & Paste’ добавлено ком.строка запуска внешнего редактора, значение по умолчанию: far.exe /e%1:%2 "%3"
[*] Уточнение снятия скриншотов (Win+H). Добавлен Win+Shift+H - скриншот экрана.

[%] В некоторых случаях после завершения консольной команды в Far возникал exception


2012.06.03
[!] Internal interprocess communication changes.
[*] Status bar. Добавлена колонка 'ConEmu GUI PID'.
[%] Issue 566: Hotkey <<None>> is not unique.
[+] На вкладке 'Tasks' окна 'Settings' добавлено поле 'ConEmu arguments for Jump list'.
    Здесь можно указать доп.параметры для запуска с панели задач (Tasks, Jump list).
    Например: /icon "cmd.exe"


2012.06.02
[!] Internal interprocess communication changes.
[+] Windows 7 и выше. Поддержка Jump list, в секцию 'Tasks' ConEmu может добавить свои 'Predefined tasks' и команды из истории.
    Наполнение Jump list занимает некоторое время, поэтому на вкладке 'Tasks' добавлена кнопка 'Update Now!'.
[+] ConEmu.exe: параметр /title "Template". В заголовке окна будет отображаться фиксированный текст, а не заголовок активной консоли. В "Template" можно использовать переменные окружения.
[+] Диалог 'Create new console': в системном меню добавлен пункт 'Reset command history...'.
[+] Win+H: Make screenshot of active ConEmu window.
[+] Tabs: Раздельные шаблоны для панелей (Far) и других консольных приложений.
[+] Tabs: Для консольных приложений (кроме Far) можно настроить список слов, исключаемых из заголовка. Надоел префикс 'Administrator:' при запуске консоли 'под админом' в Win7.
[*] Убираем задержки закрытия ConEmu.
[%] В некоторых случаях не появлялись Shell-диалоги (при запуске файлов, выборе пунктов контекстного EMenu).
[*] Minor change in (isMonitorConsoleLang == 2).
[*] На Status bar тоже действует 'Fade when inactive'.
[%] В историю не попадала команда, указанная через '/cmd' при запуске ConEmu.exe.
[%] Issue 561: В некоторых случаях ConEmuHk64.dll вызывала падение консольного приложения.
[%] Issue 564: События мыши не посылались в консоль при отключенном флажке 'Inject ConEmuHk'.
[*] Изменения подтверждения закрытия табов. При закрытии ConEmu 'крестиком' запрос отображается один раз (на все консоли).


2012.05.27a
[%] Не сохранялись изменения режима окна (Normal/Maximized/Full screen), если перед 'Save settings' не была нажата 'Apply'.
[%] Некорректные подсказки для пунктов меню настройки Status bar.


2012.05.27
[*] В системном меню и меню для таба отображаются текущие горячие клавиши.
[%] Мышиные события не попадали в консольные приложения (кроме Far) при включенной прокрутке.
[+] 'Settings' -> 'Features' -> 'Mouse options' -> 'Enable mouse'. По умолчанию включено.
    Можно отключить - запретить посылку в консоль событий от мышки. При этом остается возможность
    использовать мышь для пометки и вставки текста. Опция живет уже давно, но в интерфейсе отсутствовала.
[+] Добавлена новая опция прозрачности - ColorKey. Но для Far все-таки удобнее использовать 'UserScreen transparency'.
[+] Win+G - новый хоткей для пункта системного меню 'Attach...'.
[+] Status Bar. По умолчанию включен. Настройка шрифта, цветов и колонок (любой набор из доступных 20-и)
    в 'Settings' -> 'Status bar'. Отключить/включить колонки можно также из контекстного меню строки статуса,
    открывающегося правой кнопкой мышки. Описание колонок отображается при наведении на них мышки.
    Некоторые колонки обрабатывают left click:
    * поля 'CAPS'/'NUM'/'SCRL' - переключение.
    * поле 'Active VCon' - меню выбора консоли (аналогично меню с тулбара).
    * поле 'Transparency' - меню настройки прозрачности (100%..40%, UserScreen, ColorKey); при
      наведении мышки на пункты меню 90%..40% - прозрачность главного окна сразу изменяется.


2012.05.24a
[!] ConEmuC.exe/ConEmuC64.exe sets console text attributes to 7 on startup.
[+] 'Settings' -> 'Mark & Paste' -> 'Freeze console before selection'.
[+] 'Find test' -> 'Freeze console'.
[%] Lags in ConEmu plugin.


2012.05.23a
[%] Issue 554: Исправлена обработка ^[#G (ANSI X3.64).


2012.05.23
[*] Из системного меню убран пункт 'Auto scroll'. Если нужно поставить консоль 'на паузу' - Win+A (альтернативный буфер).
[+] Ctrl+Win+Alt+Enter - принудительная активация ConEmu в FullScreen. Как и Win+C, настраиваемый хоткей срабатывает из любого приложения.
[+] Win+Shift+Del - Terminate активного процесса текущей консоли.
[+] Добавлена переменная окружения "ConEmuANSI". Принимает значения "ON" или "OFF".
[%] Issue 554: Ошибки позиционирования курсора и вывода текста (ANSI X3.64).
[%] Issue 553: Откат прокрутки консоли.


2012.05.22
[+] Новая опция 'ANSI X3.64 / 256color' на вкладке 'Features'. Описание будет здесь:
    http://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html
    Адресуется консоль целиком (с прокруткой), но Xterm 256color влияет только на 'рабочую'
    область (нижняя часть консоли, если есть прокрутка).
    Чтобы ANSI работало - должен быть включен 'Inject ConEmuHk'.
    Если кажется, что 256 color не работает - включить флажок 'Colorer TrueMod support', проверить
    выключен ли буфер/прокрутка (например "256colors2.pl -cur_console:h0"), или прокрутить консоль
    в самый низ ("echo [9999;1H").
    Два примера: `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors16.ans` и `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors256.ans`.
[+] Win+A - альтернативный буфер, кнопка на тулбаре - черный квадратик.
    При выполнении в фаре - показывает вывод последней команды.
    Иначе - замораживает текущее состояние всех консоли (весь буфер, с прокруткой).
    Закрыть альтернативную консоль - повторным Win+A или Esc.
[*] Win+S - включение/отключение прокрутки (BufferHeight). Игнорируется в Win7. Кнопка на тулбаре - вертикальные стрелки.
[+] Win+N - Show create new console popup menu.
[%] Issue 551: Updater, Команда распаковки формировалась неправильно при использовании переменных окружения.
[+] Новые ключи ConEmu.exe
    /min - запустить свернутым;
    /tsa - сворачивать в TSA (чтобы свернуть в TSA при запуске используйте вместе с /min);
    /icon "<file>" - откуда брать иконку, <file> может быть exe, dll или ico;
    /noupdate - отключить автоматическую проверку обновления при старте.
[*] Обновлен диалог 'About'.
[%] Исключение при уменьшении размера шрифта в Maximized режиме.
[+] Добавлены три системных палитры: Standard VGA, Terminal.app, xterm.
[%] Правки в Injects.
[%] Диалог Fast configuration отображался размернутым на весь экран, если ConEmu был запущен с ярлыка, в свойствах которого указано Maximized.
[%] Исправлена некорректная отрисовка при включении флажка 'Auto' на вкладке 'Main' в Maximized режиме.
[%] Minor changes in ConEmuC.exe.


2012.05.20
[*] ConEmu is mentioned in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_managers#cite_ref-20


2012.05.15
[%] В предыдущей сборке отвалилась загрузка 'App distinct'.
[*] Максимальное количество поддерживаемых консолей увеличено до 30-и (дальше кнопки лень рисовать).
[*] На тулбаре отображается 'кнопка' только для активной консоли, а не для всех открытых (как раньше).
    При клике на кнопку - отображается меню выбора запущенных консолей/табов.
[*] Активация с клавиатуры - цифрами.
    Win+F11 и Win+F12 больше не занимаются активацией консолей.
    Если консолей меньше 11-и, все как раньше.
    Если больше - то допускаются однокнопочные и двухкнопочные активации. Например:
    ‘Win(down) 1 5’ - активирует 15-ю консоль;
    ‘Win(down) 1 Win(up)’ - активирует 1-ю консоль.
[%] Еще раз 'Sleep in background' bugfix.
[%] Issue 541: В режиме эскизов некорректно выделяются файлы правой кнопкой мыши.


2012.05.14
[%] Issue 543, Issue 544: Правим баги несчастливой версии :)
[%] Issue 56: При драге поверх окна ConEmu больше не забирается фокус.
[+] Drag&Drop: При дропе файлов в ком.строку Far - отображается контекстное меню (Paste/Goto/Edit/View).
[*] Drag&Drop: Internal changes in overlay image.


2012.05.13
[*] 'Ignore console cursor size' вместо неработавшей 'Ignore telnet cursor size'. Также добавлена в 'App distinct'.
[%] Не работала опция 'Send Alt+Space to console' (вкладка 'Keys').
[%] В диалоге создания новой консоли при запуске группы (Tasks) игнорировался флажок 'Run as adminstrator'.
[+] Issue 532: Опция 'Show TSA balloon' (влияет только на автоматический режим проверки).
[*] Issue 537: Проверяем опцию WinRar: [HKCU\Software\WinRAR\Extraction\Profile] "UnpToSubfolders"
[%] Issue 538: Неверные иконки в Thumbnails/Tiles в корне архивов.
[%] Issue 539: Некорректная отрисовка Thumbnails/Tiles поверх панели QView (Ctrl+Q) или Info (Ctrl+L).
[+] Разрешен Shell Drop файлов в редактор и диалоги. Drop, естественно, в виде вставки текста (имен/путей перетаскиваемых файлов).
[%] Еще раз 'Sleep in background' bugfix.
[*] Настройка 'Command line' переехала на новую вкладку 'Startup' окна 'Settings'.
[*] В меню (кнопка [+] на тулбаре) добавлены пункты 'New console dialog' и 'Setup tasks'.


2012.05.10
[%] ConEmu internal paste locks clipboard.
[*] Пример макроса: ConEmu\Far1_reg\TabList.reg
[%] AnsiCon вызывал падение в cmd/tcc.


2012.05.09a
[%] Issue 534: ConEmuSetup: Строка с путем по умолчанию для 64 битной версии выводится сразу после 32 битной.
[+] Поиск текста в консоли. Hotkey Apps+F или Edit -> Find text.
[%] Telnet and 'Sleep in background' bugfix.


2012.05.08
[!] Issue 65: Для корректной работы приложений, использующих SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer (telnet.exe и т.п.) требуется включить флажок ‘Inject ConEmuHk’.
[!] Чтобы в корне не маячили и не мешали фару при работе вне ConEmu - ExtendedConsole пененесен в подпапку.
[!] Полностью переделана обработка HotKeys.
    * Понятия ‘HostKey’ больше нет.
    * Для всех (почти) клавиш можно назначить собственный модификатор.
    * Исключение - системные комбинации, активация консоли по номеру (общий модификатор) и управление размером окна (общий модификатор).
    * Теперь можно использовать ‘клавиши’ WheelUp, WheelDown, WheelLeft, WheelRight (колесо мышки).
[+] Теперь можно настроить до 32-х GUI Macro, привязав их к HotKeys.
    По умолчанию, CtrlWheelUp/CtrlWheelDown меняет размер шрифта.
[%] В префиксе "ConEmu:run:" теперь можно использовать переменные окружения.
    Например, для файлов "*.cpp,*.hpp" настроить такую ассоциацию (e.g. AltF4):
    ConEmu:Run:"%FARHOME%\Tools\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" -new_console "!\!.!"
[+] Опциональное подтверждение закрытия консоли из ConEmu (Features -> Confirm close console).
[+] Portable: Рядом с ConEmu.exe можно положить файлы MsXml3.dll и MsXml3r.dll чтобы не возникало
    проблем с xml-конфигурацией в Live сборках и в Win2k. Регистрировать MsXml3.dll не нужно.
    Рекомендуется брать файлы MsXml3.dll и MsXml3r.dll из Windows XP.
[*] Немного доработано пересоздание консоли.
[*] Не срабатывал Shift для пунктов меню 'Restart', 'Restart as', 'New console'.
[*] Меню (системное или для таба) всегда всплывает при RClick на табах.
[+] GUI Apps in tabs: теперь работает пункт меню 'Attach...'
[+] GUI Macro: Tab(<Cmd>[,<Parm>])
    <Cmd>=0 - show/hide tabs
    <Cmd>=1 - commit lazy changes
    <Cmd>=2 - switch next (eq. CtrlTab)
    <Cmd>=3 - switch prev (eq. CtrlShiftTab)
    <Cmd>=4 - switch tab direct (no recent mode), Parm=(1,-1)
    <Cmd>=5 - switch tab recent, Parm=(1,-1)
    <Cmd>=6 - switch console direct (no recent mode), Parm=(1,-1)
    <Cmd>=7 - activate console by number, Parm=(1-based console index)
    <Cmd>=8 - show tabs list menu (indiffirent Far/Not Far)
[+] GUI Macro: Paste(<Cmd>[,"<Text>"])
    <Cmd>=0 - paste all lines, <Cmd>=1 - paste first line
    When <Text> is omitted - paste from Windows clipboard, otherwise - paste specified text.
[+] Keyboard: 'Show opened tabs list (does not work in Far - use macro instead)'. Default - F12.
[+] ConEmu plugin: команда в меню плагина - 'Show all tabs list', макрос 'ConEmu.TabList.fml'
[%] Issue 530: Ошибка в цветах Thumbnails/Tiles при включенном ‘Optional marking character’.
[*] Вкладка настроек 'Text selection' переименована в 'Mark & Paste'.
[+] Для консольных приложений (кроме Far) ConEmu теперь может самостоятельно обрабатывать
    вставку текста из буфера обмена. По умолчанию, Ctrl+V вставляет первую строку содержимого
    буфера, а Shift+Ins вставляет текст полностью (генерируя нажатия <Enter> для перевода строк).
    Можно настроить подтверждение вставки многострочного текста (при вставке нескольких строк
    из буфера в ком.строку cmd.exe нажатия <Enter> могут привести к нежелательному исполнению команд).
    Можно настроить подтверждение вставки длинного текста (по умолчанию 200 символов).
[+] На вкладках 'Mark & Paste' и 'App distinct' добавлена настройка вставки из буфера обмена.
[*] В 64-битных OS при запуске в новой вкладке "cmd" учитывается настройка битности желаемого ComSpec.
[*] Меню таба отображается по Apps+Space (раньше было Win+Apps).


2012.04.22
[*] Issue 527: Правим ошибки в детекторе панелей.
[%] Глюк размера при старте, если 'Hide caption' и режим 'Maximized' в ярлыке.
[*] При нажатии кнопки 'Apply' в окне настроек в полях размера окна появлялись старые значения.
[*] Не работали кнопки +/-/Up/Down на вкладке 'App distinct'.

[*] На вкладке 'ComSpec' добавлена настройка используемого командного процессора.
    По умолчанию настроен автоматический выбор между tcc.exe (если установлен) и cmd.exe.
    Также есть возможность принудительного задания 'битности' командного процессора в 64-битных OS.
    По умолчанию битность процессора совпадает с битностью OS.
[*] Опция 'Leave on close' вынесена в интерфейс на вкладку 'Tabs'.

[+] Некоторые настройки (палитра, Cursor, Extend Fonts) можно
    настраивать раздельно по имени приложения и признаку Elevated.
    Настройка на странице 'App distinct' окна 'Settings'.
    Приложения сохраняются в настройке (reg/xml) в подключе "Apps".


2012.04.14
[%] При открытии диалога настроек не включался флажок 'Long console output'.
[%] Ошибка в возврате Plugin.Call("4b675d80-1d4a-4ea9-8436-fdc23f2fc14b","...") для Far3.
[%] После Far3 build 2576 поломались макросы использующие $Text. В частности, отвалился 'длинный правый клик'.
[%] GUI Apps in tabs: "Notepad" in Win-W don't works.
[%] Убрана небольшая задержка переключения табов (редактор/вьювер) через интерфейс ConEmu.
[%] Issue 516: При минимизации кликом по таскбару не отключались Win-Number.
[%] Issue 518: Если Far 'не отвечал', то при попытке обращения к нему (переключение табов, и т.п.) ConEmu на некоторое время зависал.
[%] Issue 521: Пропадание табов редактора/вьера.
[*] Issue 248: Добавлена возможность сохранять/загружать пользовательские палитры цветов.
    В палитру входят 32 цвета (16+16) и настройки 'Extend foreground colors'.
    Именованые палитры сохраняются в настройке (reg/xml) в подключе "Colors".
[*] Issue 445: Добавлена возможность создавать пользовательские 'Задачи'/'Tasks'.
    Задача - это алиас для запуска одного или более приложений в новых вкладках ConEmu.
    Их можно использовать (на примере задачи {Shells}):
    * при запуске, указав в свойствах ярлыка: "ConEmu.exe /cmd {Shells}"
    * указав {Shells} в поле 'Command line' страницы 'Main' окна 'Settings'
    * при создании новой консоли через интерфейс ConEmu (`+` на тулбаре, список в Recreate-диалоге)
    * из командной строки cmd.exe: "%ConEmuBaseDir%\ConEmuC.exe" /c {Shells} -new_console
    * из командной строки far.exe: conemu:run:{Shells} -new_console
    Настройка на странице 'Tasks' окна 'Settings'.
    Задачи сохраняются в настройке (reg/xml) в подключе "Tasks".
[*] Minor fix in debug switch "/detached".
[*] Vista+: При детаче в консоли устанавливается приемлемый для пользователя размер шрифта.

2012.04.01
[*] Settings->Far Manager->KeyBar RClick: при подсветке пункта меню на кейбаре отображается выполняемое действие.
[*] Issue 514: Доработана опция 'Extend foreground colors with background'.
    Работает для любого приложения, а не только для Far Manager.
    Например, для Far Manager, в качестве 'заменяемого цвета фона' можно выбрать
    цвет панелей (синий по умолчанию), тогда для Far получится как бы своя собственная
    палитра цветов. Или наоборот, можно настроить цвета для внешнего редактора (Vim),
    выбрав в качестве цвета расширения его цвет фона.
    Для Far Manager имеет смысл только для веток 1.7x и 2.x. Для ветки 3.x
    любые TrueColor цвета можно настроить через интерфейс Far Manager.
[*] Issue 319: Hyperlinks. Разрешено для любого приложения (не только в Far).
    Но для открытия редактора (LClick по ошибке из консоли с cmd.exe) Far должен быть запущен.
    При наведении меняется курсор мышки.


2012.03.27
[*] Far3: после выполнения макроса ShiftEnter курсор прыгал к ".."
[*] Hyperlink detector (e-mails).
[*] Issue 505: Reattach fixed.
[*] Settings->Far Manager->KeyBar RClick: Правый клик по кейбару отображает меню модификаторов.
    Т.е. щелкнув правой кнопкой по "7Search" в редакторе откроется всплывающее меню, в котором
    можно выбрать любой F7 с модификатором, например Ctrl-F7.
    Примечание. При выборе пункта меню в консоль посылается именно нажатие, т.е. если на Ctrl-F7
    висит макрос - будет выполнен макрос.


2012.03.26
[!] Far3 build 2573.
[*] Еще раз табы для модальных окон (Far3).

[%] Правки межпроцессного взаимодействия.
[%] Ошибка в умолчаниях шаблонов табов для вьювера и редактора с изменениями.
[*] Vista и выше. При невозможности изменить размер консоли из-за пределов по размеру консольного шрифта,
    ConEmu пытается увеличить/уменьшить размер шрифта в консоли. Для пользователя это 'прозрачно', шрифт
    в окне ConEmu не меняется.
[*] Windows 7 и выше. Поддержка тачскринов и жестов.
    Длинный тап - аналог длинного RClick, открытие EMenu.
    Перетаскивание одним пальцем - аналог перетаскивания с нажатой левой кнопкой мышки (например, для Drag&Drop).
    Тап двумя пальцами - аналог короткого RClick, выделение файла. Позиция - центр между пальцами.
    Нажатие и тап (опустить первый палец, тап вторым пальцем, отпустить первый палец) - аналог короткого RClick, выделение файла. Позиция - первый палец.
    Поворот (опустить первый палец, крутить вторым пальцем вокруг первого, отпустить первый палец) - переключение табов, по часовой стрелке - CtrlTab, против часовой стрелки - CtrlShiftTab. Активация таба - после отпускания первого пальца.
    Прокрутка (опустить два пальца, двигать их вверх/вниз, отпустить пальцы) - аналог прокрутки колесом мышки (инверсно).
    Зум (опустить два пальца, сблизить/раздвинуть, отпустить пальцы) - изменить размер шрифта в ConEmu.
[*] Issue 493: При включении табов размер консоли не меняется - увеличивается высота окна ConEmu.
[*] Issue 494: Hotkeys for starts text and block selection from keyboard.
[*] Issue 495: Option for send 'Alt-F9' to console.

    Его отрисовка восстанавливается при изменении размеров окна или при изменении текста в консоли в этом прямоугольнике.
[*] Еще немного по пропорциональным шрифтам.


2012.01.15a
[+] Параметр "-cur_console[:n]" можно указать после "ConEmu.exe /cmd" чтобы отключить 'Press Enter or Esc to close console'.

    * Добавлена возможность задания цветов картинок и полосы свободного места.
    * ... задания размера полосы свободного места.
    * ... задания разных цветов панелей в зависимости от буквы диска.
[*] FindFirstChangeNotification для проверки изменений в Background.xml (плагин ConEmu Background).
[*] Сообщение о невозможности активации таба отображается под центром таба. Также не пытаемся активировать табы, если они заблокированы диалогом.


2011.09.26
[+] Пункт меню 'Terminate' и кнопка 'Terminate' в 'Recreate dialog' отображает подтверждение с выбором: закрыть консоль 'крестиком' или убить активный процесс (TerminateProcess).
[*] Упрощена настройка Background. В поле 'Replace color indexes' можно указать '*', тогда будет краситься только фон панелей Far manager.
[*] Far3 build 2204.


2011.09.25
[%] Плагины 'ConEmu Background' и плагин 'ConEmu Underlines' не работали в Far 1.7x.
[+] Настройка плагина 'ConEmu Background'. Можно задать полный путь к xml файлу, например "%FARHOME%\Background.xml".


2011.09.24

[%] Issue 429: Win-W won't works in Windows 8.
[+] Issue 425: Выделение слов двойным кликом, как в обычной консоли.
[*] Теперь можно выделять текст в фаровском CtrlO из редактора. Есть, конечно, AltIns, но тем не менее.
[+] Добавлена авторегистрация шрифтов в *.otf файлах.
[+] Issue 319: Из консоли фара можно открывать как ссылки ошибки компиляторов (вроде ConEmu.cpp(1999): error: xxx).


2011.09.14
[%] DosBox не запускался, если ConEmu установлен в 'Program Files' (путь к DosBox содержал пробелы).
[%] После нескольких вызовов окна настроек в списке шрифтов задваивались шрифты вида '[Raster Fonts 8x12]'.
[*] Issue 426: Режим 'Auto' для правой и средней кнопок мыши, копирование - если выделен текст, иначе - вставка.

[*] Far3 build 2159.
[+] Issue 422: Настройка 'DisableMouse'. Через реестр/xml можно отключить посылку мышиных событий в консоль. Некоторые опции ('Resize panels by mouse', 'Select text with mouse', и т.п.) отключаются отдельно.


2011.08.11
[*] Изменено отображение непечатных (combining) символов: accents, tildas, dot above, xFEFF и т.п. Обычно эти символы при печати располагаются над предыдущей буквой. Однако, для 'консольной ясности' теперь они отображаются в своем знакоместе.


2011.08.09
[%] Поправлено определение координат панелей для многострочной и отключенной области статуса.
[*] Доработан 'RightClick for context menu'. Курсор на файл ставится под кликом сразу (при начале длинного клика).
[+] Issue 420: Option 'Win-Tab' on Tabs page for tab switching in Windows 7.


2011.08.08
[%] Падение в некоторых случаях (например при очистке корзины через EMenu).
[%] Не работал Fade для расширенных (24bit) цветов.
[*] ExtendedConsole: отображение в диалоге Bold/Italic/Underline; включение флажка '4bit' сразу показывает измененный цвет.

    * В заголовке дебаггера отображается PID отлаживаемого процесса.
[*] Доработки для Far3 build 2082.
[*] В сообщении 'ConEmu received old version packet' отображается полный путь процесса или модуля, приславшего пакет некорректной версии.
[*] В шаблонах заголовков табов (Tab templates) можно использовать макроподстановки: %s - заголовок консоли, %i - номер окна в Far (0-based), %p - PID активного процесса в консоли, %c - номер консоли (1-based).
[*] Если какая-то другая программа скрыла окно ConEmu - в TSA отображается иконка и всплывающее сообщение об этом безобразии.


2011.06.29
[%] Issue 409: "Far.exe /e newfile" из ConEmu: Exception при выходе. Требуется версия Far 2.1 bis12 или выше.
[*] При вызове консольных приложений на экране могли мелькать цветные артефакты (при использовании расширения шрифтов/цветов).
[*] Far3 build 2078.

[%] В некоторых случаях при выходе из Far или запуске консольных команд ConEmu.exe мог аварийно завершаться.
[%] Issue 382: в поле 'Another user' диалога создания новой консоли нельзя было ввести имя в формате 'domain\user'. В поле разрешена горизонтальная прокрутка.
[%] В некоторых случаях окно ConEmu не закрывалось после завершения консольных процессов.
[%] Issue 384: Не отключался флажок 'Install keyboard hooks'.
[%] Issue 400: Правки в запускаторе.
[*] Far3 build 2027.
[+] Drop в любую вкладку, а не только в Far, например в cmd.exe. При Drop в не-Far-консоль вставляются полные имена перетаскиваемых файлов.
[*] Запуск консоли с флагом SEE_MASK_NOASYNC.
[*] Пункт 'Terminate' меню таба и кнопка 'Terminate' (диалог пересоздания консоли Win-W) игнорируют флажок 'Safe Far close'.


2011.03.08a

[*] Issue 332: Fixed/Cascade и подобные настройки не запрещаются в Maximized.
[*] Плагины готовы к Far3 build 1900.
[*] Добавлен msi для x64. Набор файлов тот же что и в msi x86, но только x64 версия может устанавливаться в 64битный 'Program Files'.


2011.03.06
[%] Правки в запускаторе.
[%] Не работал ввод через IME. Пока что ввод остается в отдельном плавающем окне, но результат попадает в консоль. Поскольку FAR игнорит нажатия с VK=0, иероглифы посылаются как VK=VK_PROCESSKEY.
[%] Issue 373: падение при запуске 'wmic'.
[!] Экспериментально. Для планируемой поддержки возможности горизонтальной прокрутки ConEmu отрисовывает только видимую область RealConsole.
[*] Разрешено сохранение опции 'Use ConEmuHk injects'. По умолчанию - включена.
[*] Два новых файла в поставке (ConEmuCD.dll и ConEmuCD64.dll). В них вынесен код сервера консоли, чтобы разгрузить ConEmuHk.dll/ConEmuHk64.dll.
[+] Интеграция с DosBox. Теперь можно запускать старые Dos-приложения в 64-битных ОС прямо из Far или батников.
    DosBox брать здесь: http://www.dosbox.com
    DirectLink: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/dosbox/0.74/DOSBox0.74-win32-installer.exe/download
    Ставить сюда: %ConEmuBaseDir%\DosBox
    Создать (или переименовать) файл конфигурации: %ConEmuBaseDir%\DosBox\DosBox.conf
    Дописать в конец файла команды монтирования дисков, смысл в том, что при запуске приложений
    в DosBox из ConEmu пути должны совпадать. Если на вашем NTFS диске отключены короткие имена
    Dos-приложение может и не запуститься. Для возможности запуска Dos-приложений из батников
    требуется включение флажка 'Use ConEmuHk injects'.
    Внимание: Диск Z: в DosBox зарезервирован под эмулятор.
[*] Через системное меню ConEmu можно было вызвать несколько экземпляров диалога свойств RealConsole. При закрытии одного из них валился conhost. /исправлено уже давно/
[*] 'Extend foreground colors...' и 'Extend fonts' работают только для Far.


2011.02.27
[*] Documentation (http://conemu.github.io/en/TableOfContents.html) updated. Anybody read it?
[%] Правки в запускаторе.
[*] Добавлена опция 'Use ConEmuHk injects'. В release сборке пока отключена.
[*] При включении лога 'Shell and processes' (вкладка Debug) отображаются LoadLibrary & FreeLibrary.


2011.02.25
[%] Правки в запускаторе.
[+] "ConEmuC.exe /GUIMACRO <macro command>". Возвращает errorlevel==0 и %ConEmuMacroResult% в случае успеха.
    Пример: "%ConEmuBaseDir%\ConEmuC.exe" /GUIMACRO WindowMinimize


2011.02.24
[%] В 110223 поломалось отображение длинного вывода последней команды в Far1.
[*] Немного макросов в папке Far3_reg.


2011.02.23
[*] Настройка на вкладке 'Debug' - что журналировать. Закрытие окна настроек == выбор 'Disabled'.
[*] Плагины готовы к Far3 build 1889.
[*] По возможности при выполнении команд пропускаем cmd.exe (например, при выполнении команды 'netsh').


2011.02.18
[!] Хуки системных функций теперь устанавливаются не через плагин, а через ConEmuHk.dll (что позволит обрабатывать не только far.exe, но и любой процесс, запущенный в этой консоли). В результате вылечен Issue 60, на подходе Issue 65 и портабельный реестр. Часть кода по ‘внедрению’ взята из Console2.
[!] Переменная окружения "ComSpec" более не переопределяется, а переменная "ComSpecC" теперь не создается.
[!] Настройки конфигурации без имени (нет ключа "/config ‘name’" в параметрах ConEmu.exe) хранятся в "Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla". Если ключ "Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla" ранее отсутствовал - он создается копированием из "Software\ConEmu".
[!] В тестовом режиме - поддержка Far3.
[!] Изменения записи событий в консольный буфер ввода (ждем чистого буфера только для мышиных кнопок).
[!] В диалог настроек добавлена вкладка 'Debug'. Если она открыта - в ней отображается журнал запускаемых в консоли процессов.
[%] Issue 60: зависание chcp на некоторых системах.
[%] Issue 364: Visual Studio post build events.
[%] При отключенной "[ ] Show column titles" не стартовал D&D.
[%] Panel Views. Не ловились изменения цвета последнего элемента панели.
[*] Отказ от WinEvents в сервере (ConEmuC.exe).
[*] На вкладке Info показывает размер и видимость курсора.
[*] Некоторые изменения умолчательных настроек.
    Включено выделение мышкой (LShift - Text, LAlt - Block). RClick в BufferMode выполняет Paste.
    Darkening = 255, Replace color indexes = '#1'.
[*] Если на экране есть выделение (Text/Block) то RClick всегда делает Copy. (Не имеет отношения к Far's Grabber - AltIns).
[*] Реструктуризация макросов Far в поставке (папки Far1_reg, Far2_reg, Far2_fml).
[*] Добавлен макрос для Far1 - изменение размера шрифта в ConEmu колесом мышки.
[*] Для включения портабельности настроек *ConEmu* достаточно создать _пустой_ файл 'ConEmu.xml' рядом с ConEmuC.exe или с ConEmu.exe.
[*] В меню по стрелке у кнопки '+' на toolbar отображаются укороченные строки запуска, чтобы меню не было слишком широким. При наведении курсора мышки на укороченный пункт меню - всплывает подсказка с полной строкой запуска.
[*] Issue 288: В меню окна (правый клик по заголовку окна) добавлен пункт 'New console...', при удерживании Shift отображается диалог подтверждения, даже если флажок 'Create confirmation' отключен.
[*] Проверка значения "FullScreen" в ключе [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console] для Vista и выше.


2011.01.26
[*] По умолчанию hotkey 'Win-Del' не устанавливается. Включается через реестр или xml-файл.
[+] GUI-макросы.
    FontSetSize(Relative,N)
     - изменить размер шрифта в ConEmu
       Relative==0: N - желаемая высота шрифта
       Relative==1: N (+-1, +-2) - увеличить/уменьшить шрифт
       Возвращает - "OK" или "InvalidArg"
    IsRealVisible
     - Проверка, видима ли RealConsole, "Yes"/"No"
    IsConsoleActive
     - Проверка, активна ли RealConsole, "Yes"/"No"
[+] В реестре или xml можно настроить "ConInMode" - флажки 'QuickEdit Mode'/'Insert mode' в свойствах RealConsole при старте.


2011.01.24
[*] Откат 'far /w' по умолчанию.
[+] Настраиваемый hotkey (Win-X) для запуска новой консоли "cmd.exe".
[+] Настраиваемый hotkey (Win-Del) для закрытия текущей консоли без подтверждения.
[+] Опция ("Multi.AutoCreate") Win-Number создает новую консоль, если номер свободен.
[+] Опция ("Multi.Iterate") Win-Number перебирает табы активной консоли.
[+] Опция ("Multi.LeaveOnClose") не закрывать окно ConEmu после закрытия всех консолей.


2011.01.23
[%] В x86 версии не запускались приложения из C:\Windows\Sysnative.
[%] 'Text selection' не копировал текст, если начало выделения было правее/выше конца выделения.
[%] В последних версиях Far 2 (при запуске без ключа /w) отвалилось включение длинного вывода программ.
[*] В архивы (7z) предыдущих версий случайно попал ConEmu64.exe. Для желающих, 64битная версия GUI доступна в msi.
[*] При запуске ConEmu без параметров Far 2 по умолчанию запускается с ключом /w.
[+] Положено начало 'GUI-макросам'. Смысл в том, чтобы дать фару 'порулить' параметрами ConEmu.
    Пример вызова через callplugin (Far 2):
    $if (callplugin(0x43454D55,"IsConEmu()")!=0 && env("ConEmuMacroResult")=="Yes") MsgBox("Macro", "Far started under ConEmu") $end
    В Far 1 (врочем, как и в Far 2) для исполнения GUI-макроса (и просмотра его результата) можно использвать меню плагина.
    Пока что поддерживаются следующие функции:
    IsConEmu()
     - возвращает "Yes" если Far прицеплен к ConEmu
    FindEditor("<FullEditFileName>"), FindViewer("<FullViewerFileName>"), FindFarWindow(<WindowType>,"<WindowTitle>")
     - возвращает "Found:<номер консоли>", "Blocked", или "NotFound"
    WindowMinimize() или WindowMinimize(1)
     - свернуть окно (если "1" - то в TSA)
    MsgBox("<Text>","<Title>",<ButtonType>)
     - показать GUI MessageBox, вернуть нажатую кнопку ("Ok", "Cancel", "Retry", и т.п.), ButtonType == Windows SDK.



2011.01.18
[%] В меню по стрелке у кнопки '+' на toolbar первый пункт мог быть пустым.
[+] Удерживая Shift при выборе пункта меню (стрелка у кнопки '+') открываем диалог параметров новой консоли.
[+] Issue 355: Что-то вроде общего пространства редакторов/вьюверов. Пример в 'ConEmu.Addons\ConEmu.Editor.fml'.


2011.01.17
[%] Issue 347: Странность показа данных на закладках.
[%] Не выполнялся батник: ver|find "6."
[*] 'Press Enter to close console' -> 'Press Enter or Esc to close console'.
[+] Стрелка у кнопки '+' на toolbar показывает меню из последних 16 запущенных команд, для быстрого запуска новой консоли.


2011.01.15
[%] Issue 350: Click right button on close icon don't work while caption is hidden.
[%] Issue 351: В Windows XP после обновления Far до версии 2.0 build 1783 перестал работать вывод консольных команд.
[%] Issue 353: Не работал Detach в FAR (CtrlAltTab).
[%] Issue 354: "mycmd ." точка не передается команде.
[*] Issue 349: При желании, в 64-битных ОС можно использовать 64-битный ConEmuC64.
[+] Тестируем первую версию msi-инсталлятора.


2011.01.03
[%] Issue 346: не работает запуск с комстроки.


2010.12.30
[*] Небольшие правки.


2010.12.25
[%] Issue 345: Падение ConEmu.exe в некоторых случаях при просмотре файлов, содержащих '&' в имени папки/файла.


2010.12.24
[%] Issue 340: При включенном ScrGadgets не работали RClick, D&D, и пр.
[%] Issue 343: Блокировались табы после ошибки поиска в редакторе.
[+] 3-е состояние флажка 'Always show scrollbar'.


2010.12.17
[*] Меню для таба.
[*] Некоторые изменения background-api.


2010.12.15
[%] ConEmu.exe мог падать при работе background-плагинов.
[%] Attach из плагина не работал, если ConEmu.exe не лежал рядом с ConEmuC.exe.


2010.12.14
[%] Can't open console data file mapping. ConEmuFarMapping.xxxx
[*] Не работал аттач из консоли, запущенной под администратором.
[+] Usability of buffer scrollbar. Прокрутка автоматически всплывает при изменении позиции в консоли. При слежении за курсором мышки всплытие и скрытие производится с задержкой.


2010.12.12
[%] В Win2k даже при наличии Far-плагина при закрытии консоли возникало 'Root process was alive less than 10 sec'.
[%] Правки /ATTACH.
[%] В некоторых случаях, при включении прокрутки (Long console output), консоль прокручивалась до самого низа.
[%] Drag-n-Drop: При дропе из некоторых источников копировался только первый файл.
[+] Drag-n-Drop: Поддержка дропа из 'устройств' папок и в папки с длинными путями.
[*] При сильной загрузке процессора ConEmu мог завершиться на этапе старта после появления в консоли сообщения 'Process was not attached to console. Is it GUI?'.
[+] Для удобства аттача свободных консолей в поставку включен файл 'Attach.cmd'.
[*] Уточнения API для 'background' плагинов. Обновлен 'Panel colorer' (исправленные исходники доступны на svn).


2010.12.07
[%] Issue 334: Правки 'Attach to ConEmu' из плагина.
[+] Issue 318: Расширена настройка действий правой и средней кнопки мышки для работы с буфером обмена. Например, на правую кнопку мышки можно назначить Paste для 'режима с прокруткой' (cmd), или всегда, при нажатом LShift. Напомню, что 'far /w' не считается 'режимом с прокруткой'.
[+] Issue 283: 'Always show scrollbar' option.
[+] Issue 333: При отключенной 'Always show scrollbar' полоса всплывает при наведении мышки только если НЕ нажаты Ctrl или Alt или Shift или левая кнопка мышки.


2010.11.29
[%] Issue 327: 'Syncho events are pending!' по F10.
[%] Issue 324: 'mh_ConEmuCInput not found'.


2010.11.28
[%] Far2 падал при попытке выгрузки плагина (http://bugs.farmanager.com/view.php?id=1604).
[*] 'Tray' переименован в 'TSA' (Taskbar Status Area).
[+] Добавлен флажок 'Always show TSA icon'.


2010.11.25
[%] Issue 298: HG & Araxis (detached comspec).
[%] Issue 321: PanelView, некорректный скроллинг при выделении элементов панели.
[%] Issue 322: Если Far был запущен без ConEmu.exe, то при наличии плагина ConEmu.dll происходило падение при открытии редактора/вьювера.


2010.11.20
[%] PanelView. Не работал в 'far /w'.
[%] Issue 317, 308: В некоторых случаях терялся PID процесса FAR с плагином ConEmu.
[%] При сильной загрузке процессора в Win7 нажатие Win+Number могло проваливаться в Explorer.
[%] Issue 316: Ненужное сообщение об ошибке записи в xml, при отсутствии прав на изменение файла.
[%] Таб не переключался в другую консоль, если активируемое окно фара заблокировано диалогом.
[*] Новая реструктуризация.
    64-битные версии ConEmu.exe & ConEmuC.exe более не поставляются за ненадобностью.
    ConEmu.exe помещен в корень дистрибутива, ConEmuC.exe и прочие файлы в папку ConEmu.
    При желании (чтобы не 'захламлять' папку фара) ConEmu.exe можно также переместить в папку ConEmu.
    Плагины для Far как и ранее лежат в папке 'Plugins'.
    Файл ConEmu.xml и шрифты могут лежать как рядом с ConEmu.exe, так и в папке ConEmu (рядом с ConEmuC.exe).
    Старые файлы рекомендуется удалить самостоятельно.
[+] Переменная окружения 'ConEmuBaseDir', содержит папку с файлами ConEmuC.exe, ConEmuHk.dll, и т.п.


2010.11.08
[%] Issue 308: В некоторых случаях терялся PID процесса FAR с плагином ConEmu. В результате мог отваливаться D&D и прочее.
[%] Issue 312: Мусор по краям консоли в Maximized & FullScreen при включенном центрировании.
[+] Issue 313: Global hotkey may be used for minimize/restore of ConEmu window (Win+C by default). Кнопку ('C' по умолчанию) можно настроить через параметр 'MinimizeRestore', модификатор соответствует HostKey (кроме Apps и без различия правый/левый). Глобальный хоткей работает только в первом запущенном экземпляре ConEmu, и только если он уже не зарегистрирован для какого-либо другого приложения. После закрытия первого запущенного экземпляра ConEmu хоткей 'наследуется' другим экземпляром.
[+] Авторегистрация шрифтов выполняется не только для *.ttf файлов в папке программы, но и в текущей (current directory).
[+] В 'ConEmu Underlines' добавлен флажок 'Hilight plugin panels'. (Плагин предназначен для демонстрации возможностей API)
[+] В корне дистрибутива помещен небольшой 'starter' с именем 'ConEmu.exe'. Предназначен для более удобного запуска Far Manager-а в ConEmu. Этот файлик просто выполняет запуск ConEmu\ConEmu.exe с теми же аргументами.
[+] 'RighClick 4 context menu'. При третьем состоянии, в течении 'длинного правого клика' отображается Throbber вокруг курсора. Когда кружок замыкается - после отпускания правой кнопки мышки будет показано EMenu.
[*] Telnet detector changed. Теперь переменная 'TERM' игнорируется.
[*] Blues16.bmp & Greys16.bmp from ccaidd.


2010.11.01
[*] PanelView. Асинхронная загрузка иконок и превьюшек.
[%] Исправлены некоторые баги перезапуска консоли.


2010.10.22
[%] Issue 311: Падение Far 1.7x при переключении табов.
[%] Правки 'ConEmu Underlines'. Включение/отключение и смена цвета налету, без закрытия диалога настройки.


2010.10.21
[%] Issue 306: Не работало переключение раскладок Ильи Бирмана.
[+] Системное меню всплывает по Win+Alt+Space.
[+] Перейти в 'полноэкранный' режим можно также по Ctrl+Win+Enter.
[+] Win+Alt+P открывает диалог настроек ConEmu.
[+] В поставку добавлен плагин 'ConEmu Underlines'. Смысл - разлиновать рабочую область панелей Far Manger. Плагин можно включить через F11 (или AltShiftF9 в панелях) в FAR и выбрать желаемый цвет линий. В настройках GUI должен быть включен флажок 'Allow Plugins' в группе 'Background Image'. Активация фичи отключает отображение файла 'Background Image'. Если вместо ожидаемой картинки отображается черный фон - вероятно движок 'Darkening' установлен в 0. Передвиньте его вправо.


2010.10.20
[%] В последних сборках на некоторых машинах мог отвалиться D&D.
[*] Расширенное логирование раскладок клавиатуры.


2010.10.19
[%] Issue 299: При включении '/log' ConEmuC падал при выходе.
[+] Добавлен флажок "Send Alt+Space to console".
[*] Доработки Background API.


2010.10.17
[!] Реструктуризация поставки ConEmu. Исполняемые файлы, WhatsNew, Addons, Settings и пр. перемещены в подпапку "ConEmu". Сделано для удобства распаковки в папку Far Manager (чтобы не мешать файлы). Удалите старые файлы ConEmu!
[!] Обе версии ConEmu (x86 & x64) теперь поствляются в одном архиве (добавлены файлы ConEmu64.exe, ConEmuC64.exe, ConEmuHk64.dll).
[%] WinXP. Консоли не переключались по RWin+Number.
[%] Ошибочное отображения в табе заголовка соседней консоли во время создания новой консоли.
[%] PanelView. При попытке запуска плагина возникала ошибка "-1" в Far x86 & ConEmu x64.
[%] Issue 218: Побеждено мелькание кейбара при ресайзе окна.
[%] Не всегда правильно работало переключение раскладок и слежение за раскладкой в консоли (Win7x64).
[*] PanelView. Изменена реакция на PgUp/PgDn в режиме Tiles.
[+] int WINAPI SyncExecute(SyncExecuteCallback_t CallBack, LONG_PTR lParam);
[*] При запуске без параметров ConEmu пытается искать FAR: a) в папке с ConEmu.exe; b) в текущей директории; c) на уровень вверх от ConEmu.exe. Если Far.exe не найден - запускается cmd.
[+] Если другие плагины Far экспортируют функцию "void WINAPI OnConEmuLoaded(struct ConEmuLoadedArg* pConEmuInfo);"
    то ConEmu.dll вызовет ее после инициализации плагина ConEmu или после аттача к ConEmu GUI.


2010.09.19
[%] При минимизированном conemu не пропадал зеленый градусник на панели задач.
[%] Не обновлялся заголовок таба вьювера при смене файла через Gray+/Gray-.
[%] CtrlBreak не прерывал 'зависшие' макросы в Far.
[%] В некоторых случаях на Windows XP при запуске могла мелькать RealConsole.
[%] Issue 274: Окно RealConsole больше не двигается в процессе работы. Флажок 'Lock real console pos' убран за ненадобностью.
[*] Для корректного отображения EMenu (во всех его режимах) перехватываются функции GetWindowRect и ScreenToClient.
[*] Issue 280: Навигация в режиме тумбнейлов.
[+] PanelViews теперь доступен и в Far1.


2010.09.06
[%] Фон, заданный плагином отображался не только в Far.


2010.09.04
[%] Issue 290: Exception triggered in CRealConsole::MonitorThread.

2010.09.03
[%] В консоли не детектился 'одноциферный' прогресс операции.
[%] При отключенном 'Fix FAR borders' не всегда срабатывал 'Enhance progressbars and scrollbars'.

[+] Background image: автоматическое перечитывание измененной картинки.
[+] Background image: режимы Stretch & Tile. Для примера использования 'Tile' добавлен файл 'ConEmu.Addons\Lines*.bmp' для высоты шрифта 16 и 18. Для 'Lines*.bmp' рекомендуется оставить в 'Replace color indexes' только цвет панелей ('#1' в стандартной цветовой схеме фара).
[+] Background image: в окне настройки разрешено редактирование поля 'Replace color indexes'.
[*] Обработка невозможности создания шрифтов.
[*] Enhance progressbars: В некоторых случаях на "темных" мониторах 25% серый не отличался от черного. Добавлен параметр "PartBrushBlack", правка только через реестр/xml.


2010.08.14
[*] Закрытие фара макросом (SafeFarClose) выполняется только если фар подает признаки жизни.
[*] Issue 281: затычка для PgUp/PgDn.


2010.08.04
[%] Поправлено движение мышки при нажатых кнопках (надеюсь изничтожено неожиданное закрытие диалогов по RBtnUp).
[%] Far начинал реагировать на 'No zone check' только после перещелкивания флажка.
[+] Достало виндовое окошко 'End program', поэтому все-таки добавлен флажок 'Safe Far Close'. По умолчанию включен. Если включить - при закрытии ConEmu крестиком в плагин Far'а посылается макрос:
    "@$while (Dialog||Editor||Viewer||Menu||Disks||MainMenu||UserMenu||Other||Help) $if (Editor) ShiftF10 $else Esc $end $end  Esc  $if (Shell) F10 $if (Dialog) Enter $end $Exit $end  F10".
    Макрос можно настроить (реестр/xml), параметр "SafeFarCloseMacro".
    Внимание! Если перед закрытием окна в Far открыты редакторы - они могут быть сохранены в режиме сохранения изменений.
[*] Некоторые изменения в установке хуков (плагин).


2010.07.04
[%] Issue 29: Сбивался ClearType при переключении режима дисплея.
[%] Issue 275: Любителям консоли шириной 341 символ.
[+] Добавлена визуальная настройка шрифта для RealConsole. Запускается с вкладки 'Features', кнопочка рядом с 'Show real console'.
[+] Перед запуском консоли ConEmu проверяет корректность шрифта указанного в настройке для RealConsole. Если шрифт не установлен в системе, не является юникодным (*.ttf), или не зарегистрирован в реестре - отображается диалог настройки шрифта.
[+] Добавлен флажок 'Lock real console pos'. При его включении невидимая реальная коноль не двигается (не 'убегает' от курсора мыши).
[*] В ConEmu Panel Views добавлен самостоятельный модуль ico (иконки в gdi+ больше не отдаются).


2010.06.28
[%] Продолжение '%comspec% /K'.
[%] Размер после возвращения из консольных приложений.


2010.06.27

[%] Падение при закрытии Far x64 при загруженном ConEmuTh.dll.
[*] Еще немного 'far /w': контекстное меню по правой кнопке, драг правой кнопкой.
[*] Плагин ConEmu.dll в списке плагинов теперь отображается просто как 'ConEmu'. Макросы для Far 1.7x переделаны на 'menu.select'.
[?] Issue 261: в поиске...

[%] При закрытии модального редактора/вьювера не обновлялись табы.
[%] Issue 244: В некоторых случаях ошибочно разрешался переход на другие табы.
[%] Issue 249: Унификация переменных окружения (ConEmuDir, ConEmuArgs, ConEmuHWND).
[%] Mouse cursor shape.
[%] Активация редактора/вьювера при наличии QSearch в панелях.
[*] Упрощен способ получения списка окон (табы).


2010.05.31
[%] Во время множественного запуска консольных программ (i.e. компиляция проекта) ConEmu блокировался.
[!] Изменен алгоритм обновления табов Tabs.
[%] После смены окна средствами Фар - слетел стек последних открытых.


2010.05.30
[%] Отвалилась установка BufferHeight на время выполнения из Far (без /w) консольных команд.
[%] В некоторых случаях колесо мышки не проходило в консоль.
[%] Поправлен 'Hourglass if not responding'.

[+] Поддержка Far2 /w.


2010.05.20
[*] PanelViews. Mouse is working now. Small restriction: when clicked item is not visible on real panel - plugin executes macro "panel.setposidx(...)" instead of left or right click.
[%] Minor D&D bugfixes.
[%] Не работал 'Edit/View console output'.


2010.05.18
[%] Strange charachers.
[*] Доработки PanelViews.

[*] Поддержка новых макросных индикаторов FAR2.
[*] Некоторое улучшение обработки закрытия консоли в режиме 'Press Enter to close console…'.
[+] В диалоге плагина 'Unicode CharMap' блок символов отображается соответствующим шрифтом. Опция 'Extend Unicode CharMap' включена по умолчанию.

[*] Доработки PanelViews.


2010.04.28
[%] В некоторых случаях после запуска 16бит приложений ConEmu не закрывался (из-за процесса ntvdm.exe).
[!] Во избежание некоторых казусов - мышиные события не посылаются в консоль, когда в ней есть прокрутка.
[*] RightClick на табе при удерживаемом Control = MiddleClick: сразу выполняется Close для фара или поднимается диалог пересоздания консоли.
[+] Опция 'Sleep in background' - снижать частоту опроса и отрисовки когда ConEmu не в фокусе.
[+] Issue 217: В настройке в выпадающих списках моноширные шрифты подсвечиваются жирным.
[*] Мышиный курсор над клиентской частью окна меняется только когда окно ConEmu в фокусе.
[*] Во время работы Telnet.exe игнорируется размер консольного курсора.
[*] Имя параметра 'ConsoleCharWidth' заменено на 'ConsoleFontWidth' (как и было ранее указано в reg файле).
[+] Для удобства, имя пользователя и пароль теперь можно ввести в окне подтверждения создания новой консоли. Флажок 'Run as' (или 'Run as administrator' в Vista и выше) по прежнему работает самостоятельно.
[*] Добавлена настройка позволяющая отключить флэшинг иконки на панели задач и рамки окна (для фара и для остальных приложений раздельно). Третье состояние флажков - мигать только иконкой, не трогая рамку окна.
[+] Thumbnails and Tiles - FAR2 only. Плагин, позволяющий в Far Manager менять вид панелей - отображение иконок, превьюшек, и прочего. В качестве бонуса - просмотр 'на лету' иконок и картинок в плагине ImpEx. Все размеры и цвета настраиваются на вкладке 'Views' настроек ConEmu.


2010.04.04
[%] Issue 197: Некорректно включался 'Hide caption' в уже развернутом окне.
[*] Обновлен макрос ShiftEnter для панелей.

2010.03.27
[%] Не работало обратное переключение консолей (по умолчанию Win+Shift+Q).
[*] Перетрях диалога настроек. Добавлена новая вкладка 'Tabs'. На ней теперь настройки хоткеев, мультиконсоли и табов.
[*] ‘Host-key’+Number можно отключить.
[*] Разрешен D&D на с активной на активную панель в режиме создания ярлыка.
[+] RClick на табе или кнопке с номером консоли на тулбаре вызывает контекстное меню.
[+] В контекстном меню (таб/тулбар) созданы пункты 'Save' и 'Save all' для сохранения открытых редакторов FAR в активной(!) консоли. Макрос для 'Save all' можно настроить, для 'Save' выполняется макрос 'F2'.
[+] В контекстном меню (таб/тулбар) создан пункт 'Detach' - показать RealConsole и отцепиться от нее (если это единственная консоль - ConEmu будет закрыт).


2010.03.24
[!] Обновлен сертификат! В старом был неправильно указан 'ComEmu'.
[%] В консоль не проходила комбинация AltShiftEnter.
[%] D&D ошибочно активировался, если помимо указанного (или вообще отсутствующего) модификатора - удерживались и другие. Например для драга ЛКМ модификатор вообще не был указан, но драг начинался при удерживаемом Alt.
[*] Изменен способ передачи ввода в консоль (теперь пересылается только через pipe).
[*] В неактивных консолях снижается частота опроса.


2010.03.20
[*] ConEmuHk.dll (обработка Win-Number) загружается только в ОС Vista и выше. У пользователя однократно запрашивается разрешение на установку хука (дабы не было вопросов 'Почему всплыл антивирус').
[+] Доработано выделение/вставка текста консоли.
    * Выделение теперь может быть 'блочным' (как в обычной консоли) или 'текстовым' (как в текстовых редакторах).
    * В меню окна добавлены пункты 'Mark block' и 'Mark text'.
    * Добавлена настройка клавиш мышки и модификаторов. Теперь можно указать когда разрешено выделение мышкой:
      только при наличии прокрутки (Buffer only, по умолчанию), или всегда (Always).
      Можно указать модификатор (Alt, Shift, ...) для обоих типов выделения (Block & Text).
      Можно выбрать действия для правой и средней кнопки мышки (Copy/Paste).
      Можно настроить цвет фона и текста для выделения.
    * Снято ограничение на флажок 'Mouse' в FAR (его можно оставлять включенным).
    Note. Paste выполняется средствами консоли.
    Note. Копирование выполняется 'с экрана', то есть с выделением в редакторе FAR не имеет ничего общего.


2010.03.18
[+] Issue 69: Добавлена поддержка выделения/копирования текста мышкой (аналог консольного 'QuickEdit mode').
    Если этим хочется пользоваться в FAR2 (AltIns по какой-то причине не устраивает) - необходимо
    отключить флажок 'Mouse' в настройке FAR 'Interface settings'.
[*] На вкладке 'Info' появился новый счетчик.


2010.03.09
[%] Issue 206: Win-Number вызывал Start menu, если Win отпускался перед Number.
[*] Documentation was started as Wiki (http://conemu.github.io/en/TableOfContents.html). Comments and additions are accepted.


Maximus5 - 2010.03.08
[+] Обработка Win-Number в Windows7. При отсутствии ConEmuHk.dll эти комбинации обрабатываются ОС.


Maximus5 - 2010.03.06
[%] Падение, если командный файл запуска консолей не содержал перевода строки.
[%] Issue 203: Уточнения в 'Press Enter to close console'.
[+] DblClick на правой/левой рамке окна растягивает окно по горизонтали, а на верхней/нижней - по вертикали.


Maximus5 - 2010.03.04
[%] Issue 198: Redraw in FAR1.
[%] Issue 199: Не отключался Fade-effect.
[%] Issue 201, Issue 202: Ошибочно включался режим прокрутки после аттача консоли к ConEmu.
[%] При включенном 'Transparent ‘User screen’' или отключенном 'Monospace' в некоторых случаях падали с переполнением стека.
[*] Minor resize optimization.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.23
[%] Issue 196: ConEmu вызывал ошибки отрисовки в FAR.
[*] Форматированный вывод настроек в XML (для новых ключей и значений).


Maximus5 - 2010.02.22
[%] При DblClick по заголовку окна устанавливался некорректный размер консоли.
[%] Issue 189: На некоторых машинах после Detach в FAR (CtrlAltTab) происходила перезагрузка.
[%] Issue 190: ConEmu20100213, выгрузка плагина ConEmu.
[*] Issue 195: Fade effect и Download Master.
[%] Убрана небольшая задержка при старте ConEmu.
[%] После запуска 'ConEmu.exe /bufferheight 0 /cmd ...' не работала кнопка перехода в буферный режим.
[%] Контекстное меню не всплывало если правый клик приходил как RDblClick (он всегда уходил в консоль как RClick).
[*] Флажок 'Auto' запрещен при выборе фиксированного размера растрового шрифта.
[*] На вкладку 'Colors' добавлена настройка 'Block inactive cursor' (курсор в виде пустого прямоугольника, когда консоль неактивна).
[+] Добавлена визуальная настройка Fade-effect (затенение содержимого консоли когда ConEmu не в фокусе). Теперь можно как затенять, так и осветлять содержимое консоли.
[*] Добавлена задержка скрытия рамки в режиме 'Hide caption always'. В диалог настройки добавлена возможность задания ширины рамки и длительности задержек.
[*] При ресайзе проверяем максимально допустимый размер real-консоли.
[*] Немного ускорена передача клавиатурного и мышиного ввода в консоль.
[+] Возможность настроить 'Host-клавишу' для горячих клавиш мультиконсоли. Ранее были жестко выбраны правый или левый Win.
    Теперь можно выбрать Win, Apps, и [правый|левый|любой] Shift/Ctrl/Alt. Можно выбрать комбинацию до 3-х модификаторов.
    Включение в диалоге настройки 'Hotkey settings' обоих флажка модификатора (например LCtrl & RCtrl) означает 'любой'.
    Не рекомендуется использовать Apps в сочетании с другими модификаторами - Apps провалится в консоль.
[*] Доработана прозрачность ‘User screen’. Место под приподнятыми панелями считается прозрачным. CtrlAltShift показывает ‘User screen’ (временно отменяет прозрачность).
[*] В поставку добавлен файл 'ConEmu.Addons\CallPlugin.txt'. В нем перечислены возможные коды команд callplugin (макросы FAR2).
[*] Доработан ресайз панелей мышкой. В FAR2 можно перед началом ресайза высоты зажать Shift, тогда будет меняться высота правой или левой панели (той, по рамке которой щелкнули).
[+] Issue 160: Разрешен драг элемента '..'. При этом перетаскивается текущая папка (не ее содержимое!).
    Внимание: допустимость такого драга НЕ проверяется и остается на совести пользователя.
    При дропе на соседнюю панель предварительно выполняется макрос:
    $If (APanel.SelCount==0 && APanel.Current=="..") CtrlPgUp $End


Maximus5 - 2010.02.13
[%] Поправлена работа в многомониторных конфигурациях (каскад и FullScreen).
[%] Issue 182: При запуске в многомониторных конфигурациях стартует с урезанной шириной.
[%] Issue 183: EMenu появлялось только после движения мышки.
[%] Issue 185: После максимизации окна в заголовоке окна отключаются темы.
[%] Issue 186: Не работал Maximized режим запуска ConEmu при старте.
[%] В некоторых случаях сразу после запуска уменьшался размер окна (ошибка установки мелкого шрифта в real-console).
[*] Когда ConEmu не в фокусе - курсор (если он видим в консоли) отображается прямоугольником.
[+] Fade-effect содержимого консоли когда ConEmu не в фокусе.
[*] Доработано проявляение скрытой рамки с заголовком. Задержку можно настроить.
[*] В Desktop режиме отключены Cascade & FullScreen.
[*] Щелчок правой кнопкой по рамке больше не сворачивает в трей. Только щелчок по крестику.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.11
[%] В 100208 поломался драг - всегда выполнялся Move вместо Copy.
[*] При перетаскивании из корзины учитывается флажок 'Copy by default' (файл из корзины не удаляется).
[*] Изменен способ активации плагина (теперь FAR1 & FAR2 работают одинаково).
[+] 'Always on top' в настройке и системном меню.
[*] Улучшена работа при наличии нескольких мониторов.
[*] Переделано скрытие заголовка 'Hide caption always'. Теперь заголовок скрывается вместе с рамкой, но
    при наведении мышки на скрытый заголовок/рамку - они появляются. Вокруг видимой части остается
    видимой тонкая (1 пиксел) часть рамки. Ширина настраивается "HideCaptionAlwaysFrame".
[+] Желающие иметь FAR на рабочем столе могут поиграться с новой версией.
    Включать флажок 'Desktop mode'. При желании - настроить стартовый размер и положение.
[+] В тестовом режиме появилась 'прозрачность панелей'. Пока тормознуто и будет переделано.
    Смысл в том, чтобы при скрытии одной или двух панелей вместо них отображался рабочий стол,
    но сохранялась возможность посмотреть ‘User screen’ приподняв край панелей (той же мышкой, например:).
    Включать флажок 'Transparent ‘User screen’ while panel(s) is turned off'.
    По умолчанию установлен цвет 'ColorKey' - '1 1 1', чтобы обычный черный консоли не пропадал как прозрачный.
    Сейчас фича заточена на: плагин ConEmu, черный фон ‘User screen’; [ ] Always show menu bar; [x] Show key bar.
    При скрытии панели первая ячейка консоли в первой строке не скрывается, чтобы панели можно было
    легко вернуть мышкой.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.08
[%] Issue 176: files dragged from archives has zero size.
[+] В файле настроек xml можно использовать тип long (например <value name="ToolbarAddSpace" type="long" data="24"/>).
[+] При полностью скрытом заголовке окно можно таскать за свободное место бара.
[+] В интерфейс вынесены настройки TrueColorer, ExtendFonts, bgImageColors.
[+] Добавлен Drop из Windows Recycle Bin.
[*] Кнопки на тулбаре стали чуть поменьше.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.07
[%] В некоторых случаях ресайз панелей конфликтовал с плагином PanelTabs.
[%] Issue 174: ConEmu.Maximus5.100206a Баг с отображением панели.
[*] Некоторый перетрях страницы настроек.
[+] В 'Features' добавлен флажок 'Resize panels by mouse'. 3-е состояние можно использовать когда на Ctrl+Left/Right/Up/Down висят макросы. В этом случае изменение размеров происходит после отпускания кнопки мышки.
[+] Issue 164: добавлен флажок 'Hide caption always'. Таскать окошко можно за верхнюю грань рамки.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.06
[%] Не запускалось: conemu /cmd "C:\Program Files\FAR\far.exe".
[%] Issue 172: 	ConEmu10020304: проблема с правым кликом на PanelTabs.
[+] Теперь мышкой можно менять высоту и ширину панелей. При наведении курсора на левый край правой панели или низ правой/левой панели - курсор меняется на сплиттер. Размер панелей меняется банальной отсылкой в консоль Ctrl+Left/Right/Up/Down. Если вы их перемакросили - cрабатывать будут ваши макросы, а не смена размера. DblClick - выравнивает панели. Отключить можно настройкой "DragPanel".
[*] Флажок 'Force monospace' заменен на 3-е состояние флажка 'Monospace'.
[*] Проверка значения "LoadConIme" выполняется только в Vista. В Windows7 проверка больше не производится.
[*] Теперь при нажатии 'Save settings' в диалоге настроек сохраняются все настройки, а не только те, которые можно менять через интерфейс. Сделано для возможности полного переноса настроек в XML из реестра.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.04
[%] Не работал Restart консоли.
[%] Что-то не то было с активацией плагина в FAR 1.7x. Вроде починил...

[%] Issue 168: null pointer exception when there is no taskbar
[%] Issue 170: в некоторых случаях не определялся момент завершения операции.
[%] Стили шрифта (ExtendFonts & FarColorer truemod) работали только при включенном 'Fix Far Borders'.
[*] ConEmuC. Если выполняется 'пустая команда' (ассоциация '@' в фар, и т.п.), то cmd.exe не запускается, высота буфера консоли не меняется.
[*] Minor changes in console resize.
[*] Minor changes in %ComSpec% /c.


Maximus5 - 2010.02.01
[+] Поддержка стиля 'Underline' в FarColorer truemod.


Maximus5 - 2010.01.29
[%] Поломалась смена шрифта 'на лету'.
[%] Плагин принудительно отображал скрытое окно FAR при запуске в Console2.
[%] Ошибочно включался Drag их некоторых меню (плагинов).
[*] Улучшения при детаче: создание нового буфера True-Colorer, по завершении выполнения команды в отключенной консоли отображается 'Press Enter to close console', восстанавливаются табы.
[*] Internal. Некоторые изменения в механизме перехвата функций.
[+] FarColorer truemod. Поддержка новой версии и стилей шрифта (bold/italic/bold&italic).


Maximus5 - 2010.01.25
[+] Улучшена отрисовка курсивом.
[+] FarColorer truemod ready.
[+] После детача FAR (CtrlAltTab) плагин автоматически цепляет созданное окно в новую вкладку ConEmu.


Maximus5 - 2010.01.21
[%] Зависание при переключении в консоль, в которой висит 'Press Enter to close console...'.
[%] Issue 161: Тормоза при AutoTabs.
[%] Issue 159: Can't determine a value of 'LoadConIme'...
[+] Во время запуска ConEmu или создания консоли в первой строке консоли отображается текущий статус.
[+] Issue 73: Добавлен флажок 'Hide caption when maximized'. При его включении, максимизированный режим (AltF9) отличается от FullScreen только видимостью панели задач.
[+] Issue 142: В настройку шрифта добавлен флажок 'Auto'. При включении и ресайзе окна - меняется размер шрифта, а размер консоли в символах остается неизменным.
[*] Скорректирован список размеров растровых шрифтов (теперь отображаются все установленные, с высотой не менее 8).


Maximus5 - 2010.01.16
[!] ConEmu теперь может работать в 'портабельном' режиме. Для включения 'портабельности' переименуйте файл 'ConEmu_Sample.xml' в 'ConEmu.xml'. Переименовывать можно после загрузки ConEmu, в этом случае в XML можно сохранить настройки, загруженные из реестра.
[%] Правки инициализации на 'чистых' настройках.
[%] Поправлена GCC сборка (xml в GCC не поддерживается).
[%] При невозможности создать требуемый шрифт (заданный в настройке шрифт отсутствует в системе) отображается сообщение об ошибке, а для шрифта рамок используется 'Lucida Console'.
[%] Issue 90: В некоторых случаях терялось положение левого верхнего угла окна.
[%] Немного поправлена прокрутка ползунком.
[%] В некоторых случаях в FullScreen не скрывалась панель задач.


Maximus5 - 2010.01.13
[%] Issue 156: Поломалось сохранение строковых параметров.


Maximus5 - 2010.01.12
[%] Issue 154: Моргание заголовка окна.
[%] Issue 155: Не отключалась опция "Enhance progressbars and scrollbars".
[%] Утечки при D&D.
[+] Одновременное использование шрифта Normal/Bold/Italic. Жирность/курсивность управляется цветом фона. Настраивается через реестр ("ExtendFonts", "ExtendFontBoldIdx", "ExtendFontItalicIdx", "ExtendFontNormalIdx").


Maximus5 - 2010.01.10
[%] Issue 151: Моргание иконки "Администратора" в закладке.
[%] Some fixes in ConEmuC.


Maximus5 - 2010.01.09
[%] Исправлена отрисовка нац.символов OEM-ными шрифтами.
[%] Issue 149: 091229.x64 - ConEmuC висит 10 секунд по Ctrl+Enter.
[+] Улучшена работа с пропорциональными шрифтами. Ширина, указываемая у флажка 'Force Monospace' теперь учитывается даже при его отключении.
[*] Оптимизация отрисовки.
[*] Для любителей консольных растровых шрифтов в списке основных шрифтов дополнительно отображаются предопределенные "[Raster Fonts 8x9]", и т.п. Warning! При их выборе можно забыть о юникодных символах.


Maximus5 - 2009.12.29
[!] Опция 'Extend visualizer' погибла.
[+] Главное окно ConEmu можно делать прозрачным (настройка на вкладке 'Colors'). При включении прозрачности отрисовка несколько замедляется.
[%] Экран "замерзал", если программа (telnet, VBinDiff, "clr:") создавала свой консольный буфер. В Windows7 пока не работает.


Maximus5 - 2009.12.26
[!] Переделан способ передачи содержимого консоли в GUI.
[%] В некоторых случаях цветовые атрибуты отображались с задержкой.
[%] Исправлены некоторые проблемы запускатора (COMSPEC).
[%] Флажок 'Monospace' (не путать с 'Force monospace') работал неправильно.
[+] Прозрачная поддержка консольных алиасов для cmd.exe/conemuc.exe.
[+] Если FAR чем-то сильно занят (не опрашивается клавиатура) включается курсор с часиками (если курсор находится в рабочей области окна). Опцию можно отключить (флажок "Hourglass") или настроить время задержки (реестр, "FarHourglassDelay").
[+] Debug: для запуска консольных команд в обход ComSpec можно использовать префикс: "conemu:run:<xxx yyy ...>"
[*] "…" в заголовке таба строго в конце.
[*] Поддержка панелей различной высоты.
[+] Настройка ("bgImageColors") для указания цветов фона, замещаемых на "Background image".
[*] Все PE-файлы теперь подписаны, сертификат можно загрузить здесь: http://conemu-maximus5.googlecode.com/files/ConEmu.cer.7z


Maximus5 - 2009.12.06
[%] Ctrl+Wheel - листание страницами в BufferHeight
[%] Не работало колесо в некоторых моделях мышек (короткие скроллы и прочее).
[%] Признак администратора не отображался, если сам conemu.exe был запущен "От имени...".
[*] Вместо суффикса " (Admin)" в табе отображается значок "Щит". Суффикс и значок можно настроить через реестр.
[*] Уменьшена задержка перед началом D&D.
[*] Поддержка изменений заголовка FAR2 (не работали RClic, drag, ...).
[*] Устранена некоторая задержка при выходе из FAR через F10.


Maximus5 - 2009.12.01
[%] Не учитывался макрос, задаваемый в "RightClickMacro2".


Maximus5 - 2009.11.28
[%] Лечим разнообразные наведенные глюки версии 07.
[%] В некоторых случаях при закрытии ошибочно отображалось предупреждение о наличии несохраненных редакторов.
[%] В некоторых случаях при запуске cmd в новой консоли не включался режим прокрутки.
[*] В папке 'Plugins\ConEmu' теперь выкладываются обе версии плагина (x64 и x86) для упрощения установки и использования.
[*] Ускорена работа "RClick4ContextMenu", снято требование к кнопке Apps или настройке макроса.
    Возможность настройки макроса осталась, но за ненадобностью переименована в "RightClickMacro2".
    (Для информации) Макрос по умолчанию теперь такой:
    $If (!CmdLine.Empty) %Flg_Cmd=1; %CmdCurPos=CmdLine.ItemCount-CmdLine.CurPos+1; %CmdVal=CmdLine.Value; Esc $Else %Flg_Cmd=0; $End $Text "rclk_gui:" Enter $If (%Flg_Cmd==1) $Text %CmdVal %Flg_Cmd=0; %Num=%CmdCurPos; $While (%Num!=0) %Num=%Num-1; CtrlS $End $End
[+] Добавлена возможность одновременного запуска нескольких консолей.
    Пример: conemu.exe /cmd @startfile.txt
    В файле каждая строка соответсвует запускаемой команде.
    Допустимо указание в строке параметра /BufferHeight.
    Если в начале строки стоит ">" - эта консоль будет активной после завершения запуска.
    Если в начале строки стоит "*" - эта консоль будет запущена под администратором.
    Пример файла startfile.txt (лидирующие пробелы и табуляции игнорируются):
		>E:\Source\FARUnicode\trunk\unicode_far\Debug.32.vc\far.exe
		*/BufferHeight 400 cmd
		/BufferHeight 1000 powershell
[+] FAR2 only. Добавлена экспериментальная фича - ASCII сортировка в FAR (в основном для файлов). Вроде работает, но используйте на свой страх и риск ;) Смысл в том, что при сравнении символов ASCII \x01..\x7F используется простое сравнение (регистрозависимо или независимо).
[+] Добавлен флажок "Fix Alt on AltTab". По умолчанию - отключен.
[*] В FAR2 больше не используется hotkey плагина. Собственно в FAR2 и макросы F14/CtrlF14/AltF14/ShiftF14 больше не нужны.
[+] В макросе ShiftEnter учитывается диалог быстрого поиска в панелях.
[*] Смена способа отрисовки окна (дочернее окно в котором ранее шла отрисовка теперь невидимое). Больше не должно быть задержек при появлении/пропадании табов.
[+] Теперь можно включать и выключать режим "BufferHeight" на лету. Для смены нажмите кнопку режима на toolbar'е. Отображается подтверждение.
[*] Опция 'GUI progress bars' погибла, вместо нее добавлена 'Enhance progressbars and scrollbars' (ранее соответствующая 3-му состоянию флажка 'Fix FAR borders').


Maximus5 - 2009.11.07
[%] В некоторых случаях после завершения консольных команд не восстанавливалась высота консоли (оставалась прокрутка).
[+] Параметр "FarSyncSize" в настройках.


Maximus5 - 2009.11.04
[%] В некоторых случаях графическое EMenu могло всплывать под ConEmu.
[*] При правом щелчке по табу не относящемуся к FAR (cmd, powershell, и т.п.) отображается диалог с кнопками Restart/Terminate/Cancel.
[+] Добавлено распознавание прогресса (процентов выполнения) в текущей строке текста консоли (chkdsk, wget, и т.п.)
[+] Обновлено распознавание прогресса в заголовке для плагина 7-zip alt.


Maximus5 - 2009.11.02

[%] /BufferHeight.
[+] AI в ком.строке. Если набрасывать файл (папку) на ярлык ConEmu - то переданное прилепляется к строке запуска по умолчанию. Точнее, это происходит в том случае, если первый аргумент начинается НЕ с '/'.


Maximus5 - 2009.10.31

[%] Не работал параметр запуска '/BufferHeight'.
[%] Лечим ресайз для режима с прокруткой.
[%] В некоторых случаях при листании шрифтов в настройках сбивался Charset.
[%] Некорректное создание OEM шрифтов.
[%] Правки ресайза при автотабах.
[*] На вкладке настроек поле 'Charset' динамически обновляется при смене шрифта.
[*] Добавлен 'ответ' в FAQ на счет растровых шрифтов консоли.


Maximus5 - 2009.10.24

[%] При AltTab AltTab в консоль проваливался 'чистый' Tab. Теперь в консоль, при активном FAR, посылается AltTab во избежания срабатывания макросов, повешенных на Alt (RAlt).


Maximus5 - 2009.10.16

[%] Задержка 10 секунд при запуске 16битных приложений, сбивался размер окна.


Maximus5 - 2009.10.13

[%] Не работал символ "c" в запущеном cmd.exe


Maximus5 - 2009.10.01

[%] Ошибочно включался Drag, если выделенных элементов на панели не было и текущий элемент - '..'.
[%] При выполнении консольных команд дублировался Ctrl-C (^C^C).
[%] Некорректное отображение символов с кодами ASCII < 32.
[%] Не обновлялась подсказка у иконки в трее.
[%] Утечка хэндлов во второй копии ConEmu.
[%] Падение при перетаскивании мышки в заголовок окна.
[*] По умолчанию Affinity не меняется.
[*] В FAR2 размер консоли изменяется через Synchro. Соответственно несколько меняется поведение при автотабах.


Maximus5 - 2009.09.23

[+] Поддержка изменений Multimedia Viewer.


Maximus5 - 2009.09.22

[%] Исправлена ошибка переключения раскладки (зеленый индикатор RusLat).
[+] В заголовке консоли/табе/индикаторе отображаются проценты выполнения некоторых консольных программ (nerocmd).


Maximus5 - 2009.09.19

[%] В заголовке окна, при отключенных табах, не обновлялось количество консолей "[n/n]".
[%] При 'закрытии' таба правым щелчком мышки FAR2 не отрисовывал диалоги подтверждения пока не дернешь мышкой.
[*] При отключенных табах 'Recent mode' игнорируется. Окна переключаются последовательно.
[+] Теперь можно настроить шрифт табов (пример в Settings-ConEmu.reg). Например, для корректного отображения иероглифов нужно выбрать шрифт типа 'Arial Unicode MS'.


Maximus5 - 2009.09.15

[%] Могли злобно виснуть (или падать?) при попытке ресайза.
[*] В FAR2 активация плагина переведена на ACTL_SYNCHRO. Теперь в макросе для EMenu можно использовать перфикс '@'.
    Текстовое EMenu теперь всегда активируется по центру экрана
    (Side effect - при нажатии клавиатуры скрытая реальная консоль сдвигается в сторону от мышки).
    В текущей версии рекомендуются такие настройки EMenu:
    Apps - показывает текстовое меню (автоматически отображается по центру окна).
    Для мыши - макрос вида "RightClickMacro2"="@F11 e Enter Enter" в настройках ConEmu.


Maximus5 - 2009.09.13

[%] При выполнении консольных команд в закладке отображался заголовок панели вместо выполняемой команды (при наличии редактора/вьювера).
[%] В FAR2 не работал макрос CtrlShiftT.
[%] Некорректная обработка слишком быстрых изменений. В частности, прокрутка вьювера левой кнопкой мышки приводила к безостановочному скроллингу.
[%] Правки некорректной высоты буфера консоли при старте (пока только FAR).
[*] На время выполнения консольных команд прячутся все закладки редакторов/вьюверов текущей консоли.
[*] ConEmuC в режиме подмены %ComSpec% теперь передает в FAR код возврата запущенной программы.
[+] Информация о реальных размерах созданных шрифтов на вкладке 'Info' настроек.
[+] Если в макросе (пока это только RightClickMacro2 и TabCloseMacro) первый символ '@' и после него не пробел - макрос выполняется с флагом KSFLAGS_DISABLEOUTPUT. В FAR2 эффекта пока не имеет.
[+] На вкладке 'Features' диалога 'Settings' добавлен выпадающий список высот для 16-битных приложений.
[+] На вкладке 'Features' диалога 'Settings' добавлена возможность принудительного (или автоматического) указания режима вывода для cmd.exe (ключи /U и /A командного процессора). При выборе Automatic в FAR2 активируется Unicode вывод, а в FAR1.7x - OEM.
[+] Улучшена работа ключа /single. В FAQ добавлен вопрос про одновременный запуск двух вкладок.
[+] Для удобства в файлы CtrlO.reg и CtrlO_View.reg добавлен макрос CtrlShiftO гасящий/показывающий панели (стандартное поведение FAR по CtrlO).
[+] В диалог создания новой консоли добавлена история команд.


Maximus5 - 2009.09.09

[%] В меню плагина под Far 1.7x отображался мусор.
[%] Не работали дополнительные языковые раскладки (например US-Dvorak).
[%] Чиним баг с открытием новой консоли с некорректным размером.
[%] Убраны ошибки отрисовки, в случае когда шрифт рамок был шире основного шрифта.
[*] ConEmuC теперь передает в %ComSpec% ключик '/U'.
[*] Упрощен выбор цветовых схем (вкладка 'Colors' в диалоге настроек). Если есть чем поделиться с общественностью - присылайте настройки :)
[*] При завершении консоли активной становится предыдущая активная.
[+] Перед закрытием ConEmu (щелчком по крестику в заголовке окна) отображается предупреждение при наличии несохраненных редакторов или незавершенных процессов (копирования и пр.).


Maximus5 - 2009.09.06

[%] Окно не разворачивалось, если было свернуто из полноэкранного режима.
[%] В FAR2 отвалились макрос CtrlO (нужно обновить reg-файл из поставки).
[%] В FAR 1.7x при закрытии последнего редактора/вьювера в табах вместо панели отображался уже закрытый редактор/вьювер (появилось в 2009.08.18).
[%] При запуске 'Run as administrator' в Win7 реальная консоль оставалась видимой, а CtrlWinAltSpace для нее не работал.
[%] При закрытии неактивной консоли не обновлялся список табов.
[%] В Win7 не работало закрытие консолей по крестику, если консоль была запущена 'Run as administrator'.
[*] В процессе FAR'а запрещено менять переменную ComSpec (во избежание, плагин FarCall ее уже нарушал).
[+] Для консолей запущенных 'Run as administrator' в заголовке (ConEmu) и табах отображется суффикс. Можно настроить через реестр ("AdminTitleSuffix"). По умолчанию - " (Admin)".
[+] Версия для 64-битных ОС. Если в 64-битной ОС используется 32-битный фар - плагин для него нужно брать из 32-битной сборки ConEmu.
[+] На странице 'Colors' диалога настроек добавлена возможность выбрать одну из 'умолчательных' цветовых схем.


Maximus5 - 2009.08.29

[%] В некоторых случаях (ShiftEnter на far.exe) не отключалось требование 'Press Enter to close console...' при быстром выходе из FAR.
[*] Некоторые изменение в общении с плагином/сервером.


Maximus5 - 2009.08.18

[%] Не работало автоскрытие табов при открытии модального редактора в FAR 1.7x.
[%] В некоторых случаях оставались 'левые' табы (часто проявлялось при открытии модальных редакторов).


Maximus5 - 2009.08.17

[%] В некоторых случаях признак модификации редактора (*) в табе изменялся не сразу.
[*] Отложенное обновление табов выполняется только в третьем состоянии флажка 'Enable Tabs'.


Maximus5 - 2009.08.14

[+] В диалоге (пере)запуска консоли (Win-W или Win-~) добавлена возможность указать текущую директорию для нового процесса.
[*] При выполнении макросов табы в ConEmu обновляются отложенно, по завершению макроса.
[%] В некоторых случаях, после завершения 16битной программы сбивался размер консоли.
[%] В некоторых случаях после нормального запуска FAR (например, через ShellExecute) не отключалось требование 'Press Enter to close console...' при быстром выходе из FAR.
[%] D&D. Иконки и имена перетаскиваемых файлов не отображались при быстром вытаскивании наружу.
[%] D&D. Положение курсора над оверлеем при длинных именах файла.


Maximus5 - 2009.08.10

[%] Утечка ресурсов (Pipes\ConEmuGuiXXX) в ConEmuC.
[%] При запуске 'telnet.exe' GUI 'замерзал' (телнет можно было видеть только в RealConsole).


Maximus5 - 2009.07.25

[%] AltTab fixed. В консоль проваливалось нажатие Alt, что могло приводить к выполнению макроса.
[%] Исправлены ошибки аттача ФАРА (запущенного не из ConEmu) к GUI. ConEmuC падал. Включался BufferHeight.
[+] Если при дропе в ком.строку удерживать модификатор (shift, alt или ctrl) в начало будет автоматически добавлен 'goto:'. Пуста ли ком.строка до выполнения дропа - не проверяется.
[+] При драге в фаре отображаются иконки и имена выделенных папок/файлов.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.23

[%] При работе в редакторе моргал заколовок окна.
[*] Немного причесан диалог настроек.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.22a

[+] При драге ИЗ проводника отображаются иконки перетаскиваемых файлов (checked in XP).


Maximus5 - 2009.07.21a

[%] В версии 2009.07.19 отвалилась передача CtrlC в FAR.
[%] При 'Force monospace' не работало 3-d state 'Fix Far borders'.
[%] Учтена баго-фича фара (например, при попытке выполнить макрос во время копирования экран 'замерзает'). Макросы, вызывающиеся из ConEmu, теперь вызываются без флага KSFLAGS_DISABLEOUTPUT.
[*] Уточнения в сообщении при выходе из ConEmuC.
[*] Если путь к ConEmuC.exe содержит пробелы (Program Files, etc.) то при установке переменной окружения ComSpec путь конвертируется в короткие имена.
[*] Макросы для FAR2 переведены на callplugin.
[*] Если при создании новой консоли удерживать Shift - появится диалог подтверждения (с флажком 'Run as administrator').
[+] Заработал флажок 'Run as administrator'. Теперь в Vista и выше  можно быстро (пере)запустить консоль с максимальными правами (UAC), а в WinXP - под другим пользователем.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.19

[!] Изменен способ передачи/обработки нажатий клавиш. Что-то могло поломаться.
[+] Табы. Если при переключении (CtrlTab) удерживать Alt - режим переключения (Recent mode) инвертируется.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.17

[%] Исправлено колесо мышки.
[%] Не работали табы и драгдроп при запуске: ConEmu.exe /cmd cmd.exe /K far.bat
[%] Исправлена отрисовка фоновой картинки.
[+] Все найденные в папке с ConEmu *.ttf файлы шрифтов временно регистрируются для использования в системе. Если в реестре настройка шрифтов остутствует - программа выбирает один из зарегистрированных шрифтов вместо стандартного 'Lucida Console'.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.16

[%] Лечим артефакты отрисовки (ClearType).
[%] Force monospace. Ширина шрифта не передергивалась при изменении флажка 'Force monospace'.
[%] Немного поправлен алгоритм определения 'темности' фона при отрисовке курсора.
[%] Событие MouseButtonUp проходило в консоль только если курсор был в клиентской области ConEmu.
[%] В ConEmu мог не отрисовываться экран (отображался только черный фон), если в реестре не были настроены умолчания для цветов консоли.
[*] DragDrop. Если папка рабочего стола отсутсвует (WinPE?) выдается осмысленное сообщение. В этом случае DragDrop должен работать, но без возможности создания ярлыков удерживанием кнопки Alt.
[+] DragDrop. Разрешен Drop в область командной строки.
[+] Пытаемся добавить флажок 'Run as administrator' в диалог подтверждения создания (пересоздания) консоли. Пока работает нестабильно - при его включении ConEmu может валиться.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.11

%) Падение ConEmu при выполнении длинных команд, содержащих амперсанды (&).
%) Исправлена отрисовка курсора на прокрутке и прогрессе в третьем состоянии флажка 'Fix far borders'.
%) При возникновении ошибки 'The requested operation requires elevation' программа запускается немодально в новой консоли, не подключенной к ConEmu.
*) По окончанию загрузки в консоли FAR (точнее, при загрузке плагина ConEmu) отключается требование 'Press Enter to close console...'.
*) Manifest.
*) Изменен алгоритм цвета курсора. При отключенном флажке 'Color' курсор белый (точнее color#15) на темном фоне и черный (color#0) на светлом фоне. При включенном флажке 'Color' курсор отрисовывается как в стандартной консоли.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.09

%) Проблемы при закрытии консолей, после открытия максимального их количества (12).
%) Поправлена активация с клавиатуры Win-F11/F12.
%) При закрытии/пересоздании консоли пропадал таб этой консоли.
%) В некоторых случаях не работало ограничение FPS.
%) Небольшие правки ресайза (Tabs, Alt-F9).
*) При невозможности создать новую консоль (их уже максимальное количество) отображается предупреждение.
*) Переменные окружения. 'ConEmuHWND' удаляется (плагином) при детаче консоли или аварийном завершении графической части. Добавлена переменная 'ConEmuDir'.
*) Возвращен 'cmd_autorun.cmd'. 'Прицепить' к GUI любую консоль можно выполнив в ней команду 'conemuc /ATTACH /NOCMD'.
+) В меню плагина добавлен пункт 'Attach to ConEmu'. Для тех случаев, когда был детач (CtrlAltTab) или FAR был запущен отдельно.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.07

%) После запуска и закрытия 16битного приложения замедлялась реакция на изменения в консоли.
%) Неправильно обрабатывалась высота консоли в 16битном режиме. Сейчас поддерживаются все стандартные высоты (25,28,43,50). Перед запуском 16битного приложения может быть принудительно установлена высота, задаваемая в настройке ("16bit Height").
*) Правки в GCC мейке.
+) Разрешена смена размера консоли самим консольным приложением (например, командой 'MODE CON: COLS=80 LINES=25').


Maximus5 - 2009.07.05

!) Эта версия полностью собрана в gcc.
%) Правки для 16битных приложений. 'Интеллектуальное' закрытие консоли. При выходе из 16бит приложения размер окна ConEmu схлопывался до 80x28.
%) Плагин не учитывал, что FAR мог быть запущен с ключом /u.
%) Исправлены проблемы ресайза при отображении/скрытии табов.
%) Win-0 ошибочно активировала 11-ю консоль, а Win-F11/F12 вообще не работали.
*) Ошибка 'ConEmu received old version packet...' отображается один раз за сеанс.
*) При ошибке запуска корневого процесса (far.exe/cmd.exe/etc.) отображается расширенная информация об ошибке.
*) При активации окна мышкой щелчок в консоль не пересылается (больше нет опасности случайно закрыть открытый диалог), а двойной щелчок (при активации) заменяется на одинарный. Флажок 'Skip activation' на вкладке 'Features'.
*) Если окно ConEmu неактивно - в консоль не посылаются события движения мыши. Флажок 'Skip moving' на вкладке 'Features'.
*) На 'Info' в заголовке группы 'Performance counters' вроде должна отображаться частота процессора.
+) На вкладке Features добавлены настройки мультиконсоли.


Maximus5 - 2009.07.01

%) В некоторых случаях (задержка запуска антивирусом) ConEmu закрывался сразу после запуска консольной программы.
%) При запуске GUI приложений их окна могли появляться под окном ConEmu. Пример: открытие папок в проводнике (ShiftEnter), диалог выбора Topic (плагин MSDN).
%) Правки в GCC мейке, убраны GCC ворнинги.
%) Консоль не отрисовывалась во время работы 16-битных приложений.
*) Расширено окно настроек.
*) В полосе прокрутки (режим буфера) вернулась поддержка тем Windows XP.
+) Перехватывается мигание (скрытой) реальной консоли (FlashWindow). Вместо нее мигает ConEmu. Если окно ConEmu неактивно - мигание продолжается до активации окна. Если ConEmu активно и мигает неактивная консоль - ConEmu мигает несколько раз.
+) К иконке Windows7 прикручен прогресс (по содержимому заголовка консоли, то есть как для фара, так и для плагинов).


Maximus5 - 2009.06.28

%) Правки в GCC мейке.
%) Кнопки тулбара иногда помещались перед табами при сужении окна.
%) Изменения в 'Window size' (окно настроек) не применялись при нажатии 'Save settings'.
%) Выпадающие списки размеров шрифта отображали некорректную информацию, если в списке не было текущего значения.
%) Не обрабатывался прогресс плагина FTP (пример: {13.1%}).
%) При изменении размеров учитывается максимально допустимый размер консоли (для выбранного шрифта в real console).
*) PictureView автоматически скрываются/отображаются при переключении между консолями. Переключения на другие табы консоли с активным PictureView заблокировано.
*) В окне настроек изменения шрифта применяются только при потере фокуса изменяемого поля ввода (пока Tab не нажмешь - не изменяется), или при выборе значения из списка.
*) При сужении кнопки тулбара автоматически скрываются.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.27

%) После 06.18 поломалось выделение мышкой в граббере. Исправлено.
%) Табы не реагировали на изменения в редакторе во время макросов.
%) Звездочка (признак изменений редактора в табе) не появлялась после первого нажатия клавиши (и не сразу исчезала после сохранения).
%) Уточнения в ConEmuC запуска команд.
%) При быстром вводе текста могли теряться некоторые нажатия.
%) Не работал ввод символа через Alt-цифры при включенном NumLock.
+) При создании новой консоли (Win-W) или пересоздании активной (Win-~) в открывающемся диалоге подтверждения пользователь может изменить запускаемую команду (например ввести 'cmd.exe').
+) Если в активной консоли в заголовке не отображаются проценты (copy/move/...), но проценты есть в заголовках неактивных консолей, то в начале заголовка ConEmu отображается максимальное значение процентов неактивных консолей.
+) При быстром драге правой кнопкой мышки выделение файлов (папок) в панелях получалось рваным (windows не посылал мышиные события для некоторых участков). "RSelectionFix"=hex:01 (включено по умолчанию) исправляет этот недостаток, досылая необходимое количество событий в FAR.
*) В reg-файле ключ "Experimental" переименован в "FixFarBorders". При отсутствии нового имени значение будет считано из старого.
*) Изменен диапазон символов, на которые влияет "FixFarBorders". До 10 диапазонов можно указать в значении "FixFarBordersRanges".
*) Если 'корневая' программа (far, cmd, ...) проработала менее 10 секунд, то перед закрытием консоли отображается 'Press Enter to close console...'. Смысл в том, чтобы видеть ошибки запуска программы, ошибки в аргументах и т.п., если таковые были.
*) Возможность просмотра 'длинного вывода' консольной программы возможна в любом фаре консоли (например FAR 1.7x запущен из FAR 2.0).


Maximus5 - 2009.06.24

%) Правки в отрисовке.
%) Некорректно передавался список процессов, что в некоторых случаях приводило к закрытию ConEmu сразу после запуска.
%) Исправлена проблема с непопаданием фокуса ввода в контекстное меню.
*) Немного добавим красивости в таб и тулбар.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.23

%) Исправлена ошибка запуска программ, если путь к ConEmuC содержал пробел (Program Files).
%) CtrlShiftTab приводил к зависанию (в режиме "TabRecent"=hex:01).
%) Правки в отрисовке.
*) Возможность просмотра 'длинного вывода' консольной программы возможна только в первом фаре консоли. То есть если запустить фар из фара в той же консоли - длинный вывод программы, запущенной из второго фара уже не посмотришь.
*) Для удобства использования режима ("TabRecent"=hex:01) после нажатия Ctrl(Shift)Tab и удерживаемом Ctrl переключаться по вкладкам в обычном режиме можно клавишами-стрелками.
+) Вернулась возможность пользоваться плагином Update.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.22

%) Правки в отрисовке и синхронизации.
+) Переключение по табам (консолям/редакторам/вьюверам) с клавиатуры теперь соответствует истории их активации (a'la Opera & Visual Studio). Вернуть стандартное поведение можно через параметр настройки "TabRecent".


Maximus5 - 2009.06.20

%) Курсор опять мигает.
%) Немного полечил отрисовку.
*) Изменен способ уменьшения FPS при выполнении консольных команд/утилит (dir/s и пр).
+) Мигание курсора можно отключить (флажок 'Blinking' в диалоге настроек).
*) Косметика в 'Background image'. В 3-м состоянии флажка фоновый рисунок отображается только в панелях. При включении флажка проверяется значение 'Darkening' и выдается предупреждение, если там 0.
*) Косметика в диалоге настроек. Ctrl-(Shift)-Tab переключаются по вкладкам.
+) В меню плагина добавлены команды для работы с табами (показать/спрятать, переключиться, активировать выделенный).
+) Добавлен макрос CtrlShiftT.reg - показать/спрятать табы.
*) KIS при запуске консольных программ гундел "... пытается послать оконное сообщение".
*) Если для реальной консоли в реестре задан шрифт, ConEmuC проверяет его наличие. При отсутствии шрифта выбирается 'Lucida Console'.
*) Косметика диалога настроек. Уменьшена задержка открытия окна. Tooltips для ComboBox'ов.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.19

!) Макросы (reg-файлы) перемещены в папку 'ConEmu.Addons'.
+) В командной строке ConEmu.exe можно указать ключик '/single'. В этом случае команда выполнится в новой консоли ранее запущенного приложения. Если ни одного ConEmu еще не запущено - выполнение идет в обычном режиме.
+) В 'ConEmu.Addons' добавлены FarHereInstall.cmd (FarHereUninstall.cmd), добавляющий (убирающий) пункт 'Far here' в контекстное меню проводника Windows. Если ConEmu не был запущен - запускается, иначе - открывается вкладка.
*) Поправлена обработка 'RightClick for context menu'. При желании можно вместо отсылки в консоль кнопки 'Apps' явно указать макрос, вызывающий меню (см. параметр "RightClickMacro2" в Settings-ConEmu.reg).
!) Изменения в отрисовке. Вся графика обрабатывается только в главной нити.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.18

%) Двойной щелчок по слову в редакторе FAR (в некоторых случаях) ставил, но сразу снимал выделение. Лечим глюк microsoft'а.
%) Правый щелчок по вкладке выполняет (после ее активации) настраиваемый макрос (по умолчанию "F10").
%) Валился D&D с панели на панель.
*) Немного изменено общение с плагином. Зависаний при невозможности выполнить команду (переключение таба, например) больше быть не должно.
*) Немного ускорен запуск drag&drop.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.17

%) Плагин падал в FAR 2 build 995+.
%) Попытка недопустить зашкаливания FPS при выполнении команд типа 'dir /s'. Слишком частое обновление экрана приводило к 100% загрузке процессора. Теперь FPS в буферном режиме принудительно занижается.
%) Лечим отрисовку (белый прямоугольник при запуске, черные полосы при ресайзе).
%) Вернул автопоказ/скрытие табов. Теперь это работает и для создания/закрытия новой консоли.
*) В окошке 'Settings' на вкладке 'Info' добавлен счетчик FPS.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.16

+) Веса (для вычисления цвета) символов прогрессов и прокруток можно задать в реестре - PartBrushXX ('Fix Far borders' in 3-d state).
+) При дампе консоли рядом с файлом '.con' создается файл '.bmp'.
+) Весь проект теперь можно собрать в GCC.
+) Макрос 'ShiftEnter.reg' для запуска ком.строки или файла под курсором в новой вкладке ConEmu.
%) Табы плохо переключались с клавиатуры, если в одном из них менялся заголовок (прогресс копирование, и т.п.).


Maximus5 - 2009.06.14

+) Если табы скрыты и открыто больше одной консоли - в заголовке окна отображается '[консоль/всего] ...'.
%) Табы, если 'Always show menu bar'. Не переключались вообще. ConEmu падал по правому щелчку.
%) Если табы были скрыты - Ctrl-Tab не переключался между консолями.
%) В закладках не отображались '&'.
*) Добавлены тултипы в диалоге настройки для группы 'Font'.
*) При включенном 'Fix Far borders' рамки рисуются всегда без anti-aliasing.
*) Изменена логика применения изменений шрифта в диалоге настройки. Старые глюки убраны, могли появиться новые :)
*) Флажок 'Fix Far borders' теперь имеет третье состояние. В этом случае ConEmu самостоятельно отрисовывает символы прогрессов и прокруток.
*) Шрифт, переданный параметром /fontfile пытается регистриться и для консоли.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.13

+) Возможность задавать шрифт для реальной консоли (см. reg-файл).
%) Некорректно отображались табы при запуске 'far /e ...' или 'far /v ...'.
%) В сборке 2009.06.12 часть консоли могла отображатся некорректным шрифтом.
%) Продолжаем бороться с неотрисовкой.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.12

%) Пункт меню 'Paste' подвисал.
%) Изменен способ отрисовки курсора (не путать с выделением в панелях). Двух курсоров на экране больше не будет.
*) Мультиконсоль по умолчанию (в новых конфигурациях) включена.
*) При запуске ConEmu основное окно могло отрисовываться с задержкой (пока не запустился консольный процесс).


Maximus5 - 2009.06.11

+) В меню окна ConEmu добавлен пункт 'Paste'.
%) Не совсем починился фокус, при щелчке средней кнопкой по табу.
%) Чиним ресайз.
%) После Alt-F9, Alt-F9 некорректно открывалась картинка в PictureView.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.09

+) Добавлена обработка параметра -new_console. Пример:
   dir -new_console c:\windows\*.*
   запустится в новой вкладке ConEmu.
   ! Вкладка автоматически не закрывается
   ! закрытие только после завершения выполненной команды и нажатия Enter.
*) Форматирование заголовка 'панельной' вкладки (изменено имя параметра реестра на "TabConsole").
+) В диалоге подтверждения перезапуска консоли (Win+~) кнопка 'Yes' - перезапуск, кнопка 'No' - закрытие, 'Cancel' - отказ.
%) Поправлена обработка аргументов в ConEmuC.
%) Продолжаем лечить непрорисовку.
%) Не активировалась вкладка (Ctrl-Tab) если из фара было запущено другое консольное приложение.


Maximus5 - 2009.06.08

* Значительные изменения. Консольный код вынесен в отдельный процесс. В результате многие ошибки/проблемы исчезли, но могли появиться новые.
+) Запуск нового процесса через ConEmuC.exe
+) Поддержка 'мультиконсоли' более не требует ConMan.exe, ConMan.dll или хуков. Управление стандартное (через тулбар или Win-Q/W/1..0/F11/F12). Кнопки создания/смены консоли можно переопределить в реестре. При создании новой консоли через шортках выдается подтверждение (отключаемо).
+) Полностью исключено мелькание черного консольного окна при запуске.
+) События от клавиатуры и мыши помещаются в буфер консоли напрямую, возможно это устанит 'торможение' реакции на клавиши.
+) Корректное завершение процесса по крестику.
?) Режим с BufferHeight может не работать.
%) Исправлены Ctrl+клавиша.
%) Не двигался курсор в командной строке.
%) Клавиши Ctrl, Shift и Alt 'залипали'.
!) Что-то непонятное с FARHints. Если создано несколько консолей (/multi) - хинт вслывает для всех консолей сразу.
*) Если произошла ошибка запуска приложения (far, cmd, ...) консоль отображается на экране с информацией об ошибке.
?) В каких-то случаях размер схлопывается до минимального?
+) Возможность не посылать в консоль события получения/потери фокуса (чтобы не пропадало окошко быстрого поиска в панелях). Параметр настроек "SkipFocusEvents"=hex:01.
%) Поправлена пересылка в консоль некоторых клавиш (Enter, Esc, Tab, ...).
+) В плагин добавлена экспортируемая функция IsConsoleActive().
%) Исправлен баг падения плагина при использовании Anamorphosis.
+) Добавлен отладочный ключик реестра 'DumpPackets'.
%) Вроде исправлено схлопывание окошка при запуске до минимального размера.
!) Убраны нафиг /SetParent, /SetParent2, /Windows7, /DontSetParent.
*) Sources. Создан новый класс CRealConsole, в который вынесен код из CVirtualConsole. Последний должен отвечать только за графику.
?) Не посылались Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break.
?) Заглушка для исправления 'непрорисовки' консоли (раз в секунду данные пересылаются в GUI независимо от 'измененности').
?) Win+~ - перестартовывает текущую консоль (у пользователя запрашивается подтверждение).
*) Ключи /conman & /nocoman заменены на /multi & /nomulti.
+) Вернул режим BufferHeight.
+) При запуске консольных программ из FAR автоматически увеличивается размер буфера.
+) Чтобы FarHints не показывал хинты для всех открытых консолей одновременно - в каталоге с плагином временно лежит infis.dll (от конмана там только имя файла).
-) До лучших времен отключена возможность выделения мышкой в режиме BufferHeight.
*) ConEmuC.exe собран без использования VC-шных библиотек.
+) В первой закладке вместо 'Console/Panels' отображается заголовок консольного окна и динамически обновляется.
+) Закладки отображаются для всех консолей разом, позволяя 'прозрачно' переключаться между ними.
+) При наведении мышки на закладку с обрезанным заголовком (…) отображается тултип.
*) Общение с плагином переведено на пайпы.
%) Плагин подвисал при попытке переключения между закладками, если в панелях было активировано верхнее меню.
%) Для всех кнопок тулбара в тултипе отображался заголовок активной консоли.
%) Фокус в закладку больше не попадает, вернул закрытие закладки правой и средней кнопкой мышки.
+) GUI теперь может сам обрабатывать переключение табов (окон) с клавиатуры. Так что теперь переключение между консолями прозрачно для пользователя.
%) Фикс запуска команд.
%) Поправлена работа флажка 'Monospace' (не путать с 'Force monospace'). На некоторых моноширных шрифтах (i.e. 'Fixedsys') буквы под курсором прыгали влево.
%) При смене параметров шрифта/сглаживания в окне настройки экран не обновлялся или портился.

*) Изменен способ передачи содержимого консоли, глюк непрорисовки может исчезнуть.
+) Долгожданный просмотр вывода консольной программы. Пример макроса на CtrlO лежит в папке плагина.
%) После создания новой консоли фокус ввода мог "уходить" из ConEmu.
%) Исправлено несколько глюков ресайза.
*) В режиме с прокруткой полоса прокрутки больше не отображается постоянно и не отъедает место. Она всплывает при наведении мышки. О ее наличии сигнализирует 'нажатая' кнопка 'BufferHeight mode' на панели инструментов.
+) В консоль пересылаются нажатия XBUTTON1 & XBUTTON2 (у меня это наклон колеса мышки влево/вправо). Пример макроса в MouseWheelTilt.reg.

+) Форматирование консольного вывода (пустые строки в начале и конце в редактор/вьювер не попадают).
+) В меню плагина отображается дополнительная команда - открыть консольный вывод во вьювере.
+) При XLat в Far меняется индикатор языка в ConEmu (точнее смотрите параметр MonitorConsoleLang).
%) Продолжаем лечить непрорисовку.
%) ConEmuC падал при запуске команд cmd.
%) Лечим глюки ресайза.

* При изменении размера окна мышкой - консоль опять ресайзится сразу.
* При открытом PictureView левая и верхняя граница окна 'не таскается' мышкой.
* Исправлена реакция на изменение размера буфера из консольного приложения.
* В основной иконке ConEmu добавлен 48x48x256.
* Новая попытка исправить глюк неоткрытия окна настроек.
* Немного подправлено открытие окон каскадом.
* В формате заголовков закладок можно использовать "%i' - номер окна.
??? возможно
* Ускорено отображение изменений в консоли + ConEmu меньше использует процессор.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.24

* Поправлена отрисовка окна во время запуска приложения.
* Попытка исправить глюк неоткрытия окна настроек.
* Правим ошибки ресайза.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.23

* Правим ошибки ресайза.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.22

* В окне настройки добавлена кнопка 'Apply' для применения изменений в группе 'Window size'.
* При открытом PictureView запрещено изменение размера окна.
* После закрытия PictureView передергивался размер консоли -> было мигание.
* После двойного щелчка по заголовку (maximize) в консоль проваливался LButtonUp.
* Изменен 'умолчательный' символ активации плагина.
* Изменен набор примеров макросов в каталоге плагина:
  + AltEnter_Exec.reg  - перенаправить вывод консольной программы в редактор (выполняется содержимое командной строки).
  + AltEnter_Props.reg - отобразить стандартный диалог свойств файла (проводник Windows).

Maximus5 - 2009.04.19

* Временно убрана поддержка ConMan.
* В предыдущей версии отвалилось изменение размера окна.
* Выскакивала ошибка: Can't start 'TabBarClass::Retrieve'. Last operation 'TabBarClass::Retrieve' was not finished!
* При попытке сменить Ansi-aliasing - выскакивал 'Assertion'.
* Оптимизация отрисовки при ресайзе.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.15

* Улучшен внешний вид панели с табами и кнопками ConMan-а.
* При выделении мышкой в режиме BufferHeight выделение 'прыгало'.
* При смене заголовка неактивной консоли ConMan-а мигали табы.
* Если табы отключены - не пытаемся получить информацию о них из плагина.
* Кнопка альтернативной консоли (панель конмана) не включалась при Win-A.
* Драг теперь начинается только при клике в рабочую облась панелей (сервисные области игнорируются).

Maximus5 - 2009.04.12

* Изменен внешний стиль табов (пока просто кнопки).
* В режиме BufferHeight не работало выделение мышкой.
* Попытки поправить неудачные выставления размеров консоли.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.10

* При открытии PictureView отстанавливалась отрисовка всех остальных окон ConEmu.
* Чтение содержимого консоли вынесено в отдельную нить.
* Проблемы с отрисовкой правого и нижнего края окна.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.07

* Поправки в работе с мышью.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.06

* Изменен способ пересылки мышиных событий в консоль.
* В режиме Window size = Normal - окна могут открываться каскадом.

Maximus5 - 2009.04.02

* Бонус :-) можно настроить 'автозапуск' КонЭму при запуске cmd.exe или любого пакетного файла. Запустить один раз 'cmd_autorun.cmd /i'.
* Побеждено мелькание консольного окна при старте программы. В редких случаях, когда запуск идет с ярлыка и не разворачаивая окно на весь экран, чтобы избежать мелькания - укажите в свойствах ярлыка 'Run - Minimized'.
* Оптимизация отрисовки курсора.
* Во время загрузки приложения (i.e. 'far.exe') в заголовке окна отображается строка запуска.
* В консоль больше не пересылается WM_SYSCOMMAND с wParam>=0xF000, ибо консольное окно странно реагирует и часто перехватывает фокус.
* Добавлен параметр '/max' (а для разрабочиков '/debug' & '/debugi').

Maximus5 - 2009.04.01

* Не работал CtrlWinAltSpace при /SetParent.
* Сменилась отрисовка курсора.
* На вкладке 'Info' отображается полная строка запуска ConEmu.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.29

* Небольшие правки в dll-ках ConMan.
* После попытки драга с областей за пределами панелей постоянно выскакивала ошибка "Can't open file mapping" (проблема с таймаутом пока осталась).

Maximus5 - 2009.03.28

* Опция 'Minimize to tray'.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.27

* Копирование/перемещение (при Drop из внешних приложений) выполняется в отдельной нити, т.е. во время копирования больших файлов можно продолжать работу в FAR.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.26

* Разрешен Drag с временной панели. Запрещен Drop на плагиновые панели из внешних приложений.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.25

* При Drag-n-Drop в FAR 1.7x плагин падал.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.24

* При Drop файлов из внешних приложений срабатывал Move вместо Copy.
* После включения флажка 'ConMan', ConEmu не запускался, если отсутсвовали необходимые dll-ки.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.22

* Не срабатывал Drag.
* В диалог настройки добавлен флажок 'ConMan'. Его можно использовать вместо параметра запуска '/ConMan'.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.20

* Плагин вис в FAR 1.7x ('...Waiting for result (10 sec)').
* Лечим падение при драге в Windows Vista.
* Поддержка дропа элементов, не являющихся файлами (например из Outlook). В этом случае доступно только копирование, так что если видите 'запрещающий курсор' - жмите Ctrl.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.19

* Изменения в DragDrop.
  Drag возможен как левой так и правой кнопкой мышки (разрешаются в настройке раздельно).
  При драге, текущее действие отобржается курсором (Copy - курсор с плюсиком, Link - со стрелкой).
  Разрешено создание ярлыков (только когда выделен один файл или одна папка).
  При драге правой кнопкой мышки во ВНЕШНИЕ приложения - всплывает контекстное меню (copy/move/link).
  Для каждой кнопки мышки можно указать клавишу-модификатор (например LeftCtrl), удерживать которую необходимо при клике.
  Флажок 'Copy by default' теперь имеет только два состояния и определяет именно действие по умолчанию (остальные при этом не запрещаются).
  При перетаскивании между панелями (режим Copy/Move) обработка передается в FAR (F5/F6).
  Drop разрешен только при включенном флажке 'Allow Drop', который имеет 3 состояния.
  'Off' - Drop НЕ разрешен из ВНЕШНИХ приложений, между панелями - разрешен;
  'On' - Drop разрешен как из внешних приложений, так и между панелями;
  '3s' - то же, что и 'On', но подтверждения копирования/перемещения между панелями не производится.
  Во время драга можно использовать стандартные модификаторы для принудительного включения режима:
  'Ctrl' - копирование, 'Shift' - перемещение, 'Alt' - создание ярлыка.
  Нажатие 'Esc' - отменяет драг.
* Параметр (PID) для ключа '/Attach' необязателен. При отсутствии PID - пытаемся подхватить текущее консольное окно.
* Не активировалась мышкой вкладка 'Panels'.
* Попытка не менять размер консоли в конмане (только при переключении кнопками).
* В диалоге настройки для некоторых элементов (пока DragDrop) включены всплывающие подсказки. Есть желание написать подсказки к другим элементам - Welcome :)
* Ошибки разбора командной строки.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.11

* Попытка исправить глюк с неработающим CtrlWinAltSpace.
* Перед началом Drag'n'Drop или после его окончания выделение могло перескакивать на другой файл(папку).
* Исправлена 100% загрузка в свернутом состоянии.
* Поправил табы - в некоторых случаях могли не обновляться после смены списка окон.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.10

* Исправлен глюк с горизонтальным курсором при наличии фоновой картинки.
* На время работы 16бит. приложения для ConEmu устанавливается высокий приоритет.
* Не работала панель с кнопками конмана.

Maximus5 - 2009.03.09

* Для кнопок конмана отображаются всплывающие подсказки.
* Функции FAR API теперь выполняются в основном потоке, активация плагина через макрос F14 (создается автоматически).
! Изменен способ передачи информации о закладках (возможны глюки).
* Курсор теперь отрисовывается немного по другому, мусора от курсора вроде быть не должно.
* Возможность явного указания процессоров, на которых выполняется ConEmu ("AffinityMask").
* При запуске 16битного приложения размер окна не изменяется, а консоль (80x25) отрисовывается в центре. Передключаться конманом до выхода из 16бит приложения не рекомендуется.
* Продолжение BufferHeight. Автоматическое включение прокрутки при увеличении буфера консольным приложением.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.26

* Плагин валился при драге в FAR 2.0 build 789+.
* Для запуска ConMan рекомендуется использовать версию 2.34.4 и ключик /ConMan (вместо ConMan.exe).
* При наличии табов и ключика /ConMan появляется панель с кнопками для управления конманом.
* Вроде починил глюк отображения символа под курсором.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.26

* Изменены счетчики производительности (вкладка 'Info' окна настроек). Отображаются в миллисекундах.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.25

* Корректный Drag'n'Drop и обновление табов при смене консолей КонМана.
* В окно настроек добавлена вкладка 'Info', на которую переехали Render times и добавлена информация о консольных процессах.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.24

* Поддержка изменений API FAR2 build 789 (плагин работает в FAR2 build 757 и выше или FAR 1.7x build 2470 и выше).
* В Windows Vista и выше по умолчанию были недоступны некоторые юникодные символы (например троеточие '…', иероглифы, и др.), т.к. для реальной консоли не устанавливался TTF шрифт.
* Расширение визуализатора не работало в конмане.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.23

* При выходе из окна настроек (при включенных табах) ранее открытые табы пропадали.
* 'Background image' теперь отображается и при включенном 'Force monospace'.
* Чуть поправил закрытие окна и завершение плагина. Вроде бы проблем с ExitFAR(W) больше быть не должно.
* Потихоньку совершенствуем поддержку пропорциональных шрифтов.
* В плагин добавлена информация о версии.
* В меню добавлен пункт 'Dump...' для сохранения текущего содержимого консоли в файл.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.21

* Изменения в ресайзе окна, корректировка начального положения.
* Отображение непечатных символов в редакторе (Tab,Eol,Eof). Настраивается на закладке цветов. Необходим плагин Visualizer! Отображаемые на их месте символы можно настроить (см. Settings-ConEmu.reg).
* Расширенные цвета консоли (16..31) не сохранялись в реестр.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.20

* Диалог настроек разбит на две вкладки.
* Для тех, кому не хватает 16 цветов консоли, добавлена возможность использовать 32 цвета текста ;) за счет игнорирования одного из выбираемых цветов фона.
* Настройки цветов теперь сохраняются в ключе ConEmu, ключ консоли не трогается. Умолчания для цветов (в новой конфигурации) по прежнему берутся из свойств консоли.
* Изменения в ресайзе окна...

Maximus5 - 2009.02.18

* Размер окна FullScreen/Maximized/Normal теперь устанавливается другим способом.
* В плагине изменен способ поиска окна ConEmu (переменная среды больше не используется из-за КонМана, хотя и устанавливается).

Maximus5 - 2009.02.17

* Добавлен параметр '/Attach <PID>'. При его указании ConEmu не запускает новый процесс, а пытается подключиться (внедриться) к уже существующему консольному приложению, указываемому через код процесса (<PID>).
* При отключении FARа от консоли (Ctrl-Alt-Tab) плагин предлагает запустить новый экземпляр ConEmu, который 'подхватит' новую консоль FARа (переключалка по табам при этом к сожалению отключается).

Maximus5 - 2009.02.16

* Изменен способ разворачивания окна в FullScreen. Проблем с расширениями, внедряющимися в рамку окон (типа FileBox eXtender) больше не будет.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.15

* Изменена обработка WM_SETFOCUS:
?) Не должно быть проблем с активацией диалога настроек в Vista.
?) Наверное Win+R больше не будет появляться под ConEmu.
?) Возможно (хотя и не должны), могут появиться другие глюки, например клавиши не будут проходить в FAR.
* Поправленный reg-файл.
* Переделано общение с плагином при Drag'n'Drop. Раньше ConEmu мог подвисать.
* Теперь 'Таб' пытается закрыться и по щелчку правой кнопкой мышки (на тачпадах средней кнопки нет вообще).
* Исправлена ошибка сохранения положения минимизированного окна.
* Макрос для 'табов' создается автоматически, после подтверждения пользователем.
* В плагине вернулись lng-файлы - подверждение для создания макроса.
? Может быть перестанет валиться при выходе, если присутствует PowerShellFar.
? Ready to ConMan & FarHints.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.13

* В ConMan внесены необходимые изменения (2.34.1) для его использования без ключика '/SetParent'.
* Если обновлять ConMan не хотите - можно использовать ключик '/SetParent2' (но тогда отвалится FarHints).
* Вроде бы решена проблема непереключения раскладки при отсутсвии ConIme.
* Если в окошке предупреждения о 'LoadConIme' нажать кнопку 'Cancel' - оно больше не появится (надеюсь).
* Изменилось (вернулось) имя класса главного окна ConEmu.
* Соответственно, обновился враппер PictureView.
* Создается переменная среды 'ConEmuArgs', содержащая аргументы запуска ConEmu.
* Флажок 'Always update con.handle' включается автоматически, если в строке запуска есть conman.exe.
? Теоретически, можно организовать табы и для консолей ConMan... Высказываемся ;-)

Maximus5 - 2009.02.11

* При нажатии Alt+кнопка раздавался писк.
* Врапперу PictureView опять не нужен ConEmu.dll.
* Табы теперь отображаются с рамкой. Если хотите как раньше - только заголовки:
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla]
  "TabFrame"=hex:00

Maximus5 - 2009.02.10

* SlideShow для PictureView мог не работать (особенно в FullScreen).
* Новый враппер для PictureView.
* В трее отображается та же иконка, что и в главном окне.
* В заголовке диалога 'About' отображается версия ConEmu.
* Если PictureView работает в режиме Ctrl-Q - не отрисовывалась видимая часть консоли.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.08

* Лечим глюки в отображении фона (картинок). Утечки, стек, проблемы с меньшими чем экран изображениями, с шириной некратной 4, некорректные дескрипторы и прочие прелести (и как это работало?).
* Иконка в окне диалога настроек.
* Автоскрытие табов при третьем положении флажка.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.07

* Отрисовка теперь идет в дочернем окне ConEmu (возможны глюки).
* Изменена логика ресайза окна.
* Возможность центрирования содержимого окна в полноэкранном и развернутом режимах.
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla]
  "TryToCenter"=hex:01
* 'Интеллектуальное' появление/исчезновение табов.
* При использовании BufferHeight после запуска FAR отключается режим консоли 'QuickEdit' при выходе из FAR - возвращается обратно.
! Практически все функции разнесены по классам, многие события вынесены в отдельные методы.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.05

* Попытка запустить не работающий 'Force monospace'. Буковки в этом режиме теперь центрируются.
* Добавлена возможность принудительной установки ширины букв в этом режиме (в Arial, например, ширина по умолчанию получается очень большой).
* Потихоньку пишем 'FAQ-ConEmu.txt'. Есть что добавить - присылайте.
* Можно было открыть несколько диалогов настроек.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.03

* Кнопки 'OK' в настройке плагина больше нет. Кнопка 'Save settings' после сохранения закрывает окно настроек.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.03

* Плагин: Оптимизация выделения памяти и пересылки информации о табах.
* Плагин собирается в GCC.

Maximus5 - 2009.02.02

* В заголовке окна настроек отображается имя конфигурации (если при запуске ConEmu был указан ключ /Config).
* Минимальный размер окна консоли - 28x9.
* [DEBUG сборка] консоль отрисовывается в дочернем окне. сильно моргает. с чего бы это?

Maximus5 - 2009.02.01

* Глючил размер буфера консоли, если в свойствах ярлыка было указано 'Maximized'.
* Ключик /fontfile - загрузка шрифта из файла (by Mors).
* Поддержка Windows XP themes.
* Добавлен примерный файл настроек реестра Settings-ConEmu.reg.
* Форматирование заголовков табов. Умолчания можно изменить в реестре (см. TabPanels, TabEditor,...).
* Исправлена утечка памяти в юникодной части плагина.

Maximus5 - 2009.01.30

* Поддержка изменений API FAR2 build 757 (плагин работает в FAR2 build 748 и выше или FAR 1.7x build 2470 и выше).
* Оптимизация вызовов FAR API. Не освобождалась память, выделенная функциями API.
* Третье состояние флажка 'Enable Tabs' - закладки появляются при открытии редактора/вьювера. Если включен - закладки отображаются всегда.

Maximus5 - 2009.01.27

! Попытка интегрировать Drag с ФАРовским копированием пока не удалась - глючит и повисает.
* Расширенное сообщение об ошибке, если не удалось запустить процесс (far, cmd, /cmd).
* Починил Drag'n'Drop в ConMan.

Maximus5 - 2009.01.26

* Если рядом с ConEmu.exe лежит одноименная иконка - грузится именно она.
  Если файла иконки нет - загружаем встроенную в ConEmu, номер иконки (1,2,3) можно указать в реестре. Пример:
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla]
  "IconID"=dword:00000003
* При бросании файла в корень диска (Vista) возникала ошибка.
* При Drag'n'Drop между панелями внутри одного FAR'а открывается встроенный диалог копирования/перемещения (Ctrl пока не учитывается).
* Флажок 'RightClick for context menu' имеет три состояния.
  (Отключен) - все нажатия правой кнопки мышки пересылаются в FAR без изменений;
  (Включен) - если курсор не двигался, то при отпускании правой кнопки отображается контекстное меню (на кнопке Apps должен быть соотвествующий макрос); если курсор двигался - пересылаются в FAR без изменений;
  (3 состояние) - меню отображается если кнопка мышки удерживалась более 0.3 сек. а курсор не двигался, иначе - пересылаются в FAR без изменений.


Maximus5 - 2009.01.25

* Пока автор плагина FarHints не научит его работать с новым ConEmu - версию для FAR2 можно использовать через Wrapper.
* Не отображался Help для плагина PictureView.

Maximus5 - 2009.01.24

* Установка родителя по умолчанию более не делается. Плагин PictureView использовать через Wrapper.
* В некоторых случаях в консоли появлялась горизонтальная прокурутка, проводящая к глюкам отображения.
* После изменения размеров окна ConEmu с открытым PictureView размер консоли и самой картинки не менялся.
* При листании картинок в PictureView на экране могли появляться глюки.
* Добавлен режим SlideShow для PictureView. Включается кнопкой Pause. Задержку можно увеличивать/уменьшать кнопками -/= (между '0' и BackSpace на основной клавиатуре). Отключется режим нажатием любой другой кнопки, или Pause.
  Задержка задается в реестре в миллисекундах, пример:
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla]
  "SlideShowElapse"=dword:00001000

Maximus5 - 2009.01.23

* Неизвестно почему - отвалилась установка шрифта в консоли. По какой-то причине OpenProcess в setconsoleinfo.cpp возвращал NULL (если кто хочет - поковыряйтесь). Если сие так - используем (-1)
* Вернулась версия для FAR Ansi. Плагин conemu.dll может использоваться как в FAR 1.71 build 2470 (и выше), так и в FAR 2.0 build 748 (и выше).
* Вроде починил изменение размера окна при появлении табов.
* Табы не работали, если не устанавливался родитель для окна консоли.
* Могли падать при включенных табах если полный путь к файлу в редакторе был длинным.
* Если случилось несчастье и ConEmu упал - отображается соответствующее сообщение и (после OK) процесс FAR.exe прибивается (раньше оставался висеть), консоли все-равно уже нету.
* Для запускаемого из-под ConEmu процесса устанавливается переменная окружения ConEmuHWND (пример: ConEmuHWND=0x000b0a9c). Может кому понадобится...

! Вроде бы курсор во Viewer мигает при появлении табов?
! Глюки с буферами, сдвигами экрана, черным фоном под частично прорисованными панелями и т.п лезут если консоль физически не влезает в экран. Чтобы этого не было - выберите шрифт поменьше через меню 'Console properties'

Maximus5 - 2009.01.21

* Иногда после Shell'овского drop на пассивную панель отрабатывал drop в самом FAR (хотя может и не до конца вылечилось?)
* Shell'овский drop мог отрабатывать два и более раз подряд
* Убран двойной слеш при перетаскивании с корня диска
* Плагин мог валиться, если путь перетаскиваемого превышал MAX_PATH, или текущий путь превышал MAX_PATH при бросании (ежели такое может быть в FAR'е)
! К сожалению, FCTL_GETPANELSHORTINFO не заполняет lpwszCurDir
* Флажок 'Copy by default' теперь имеет три состояние.
  Если выключен - элемент ВСЕГДА перемещается, в том числе и в другие приложения.
  Если включен - ВСЕГДА копируется, в том числе и в другие приложения.
  При третьем состоянии - копируется при Drop в панель FAR, а при Drop в другое приложения - определяется приложением-приемником (для проводника это копированием между дисками и перемещение в пределах одного диска).
  Для облегчения понимания действий в предыдущих строках не упоминается модификатор - нажимая Ctrl можно переключать действие как при Drag (если только флажок не в третьем состоянии) так и при Drop.
* Добавлены ключики /SetParent и /DontSetParent (aka /Windows7). В Windows7 и выше по умолчанию родитель консольного окна не меняется, отрицательное значение /BufferHeight более не влияет. Установка родителя требуется для некоторых плагинов: PictureView, Conman, ...

Maximus5 - 2009.01.20

* Убраны задержки при таскании диалогов
* Всплывающее меню теперь всплывает при задержке и отпускании правой кнопки, и его можно убрать клавишей Esc
* При включенном 'RightClick for context menu' теперь можно выделять файлы двигая мышкой с зажатой правой кнопкой
* При попытке выделить блок через Alt+Ins - включался Drag'n'Drop
* WM_MOUSEMOVE беспрерывно посылался в консоль, даже если курсор мышки не двигался (хм? может так и надо было?)
* ConEmu рушился, если длина заголовка консоли превышала MAX_PATH символов
* Убрана ошибка изменения размера окна после появления 'табов'

Maximus5 - 2009.01.19

* Уменьшен по высоте диалог настроек
* Добавлен пункт меню 'Console properties'
* Добавлена обработка параметра /BufferHeight (сборка NightRoman)






alex_itd - 2009.01.18

* вроде поправил глюк с AltEnter
* частично переписал общение с плагином через пайпы
* детект закрытия фара как советовал DrKnS (проверяйте Updater)
* отключил XP темы у прогресс баров (темами не пользуюсь, проверить не могу) (чуть попозже сделаю подстройку цвета под палитру)

* Drag'n'Drop теперь работает только на файловых панелях
* крыжик в настройках Drag'n'Drop 'Copy by default'
* фикс переключения раскладки от Maximus5
* фикс мелких шрифтов от NightRoman



= 2009.01.18 === (NightRoman changelog below) ===

Roman Kuzmin (aka NightRoman)
https://github.com/nightroman/FarNet
PowerShell and .NET in FAR Manager

*) Решена проблема отрисовки больших окон с мелкими шрифтами, иными словами
большого буфера данных, на котором функции ReadConsoleOutput*() не работают.
Идея построчного чтения буфера заимствована из FAR исходников, но этот режим
включаем только при сбоях, а не при превышении фиксированного лимита, как там.

*) Добавлены конфигурации, что позволяет иметь разные наборы настроек для
разных программ или тех же программ, но в разных окнах. Конфигурация задается
только в командной строке параметром /Config ConfigName, в реестре создается
подключ ConEmu\ConfigName, где и хранятся индивидуальные настройки. Пример:

 ConEmu /Config ScrollMode /BufferHeight 9999 /Cmd PowerShell.exe

использует существующую (или создает новую, если будет сохранение опций)
конфигурацию 'ScrollMode'. Там в диалоге настроек заточим окно под вкусы
консоли с прокрукой, а не Фара: настройки порой хочется иметь разные.

*) Добавлен файл About-ConEmu.txt - микро хелп с официальной и технической
информацией, а то техническая нигде толком и не упомянута кроме форума.

*) В прошлой неупомянутой тут версии для режима с высотой буфера устранены
скачки выделения мышью. Это сделано вычурно, но работает, и другие пути не
найдены - невидимое настоящее окно консоли динамически двигается вместе с мышью
так, чтобы относительные координаты мыши в нем соответствовали текущим в
видимой виртуальной консоли - так удается перехитрить неизвестно что, но от
чего выделение могло прыгать.


= Experimental BufferHeight and some fixes 2008.07.03 =

ЗАПУСК С УСТАНОВКОЙ ВЫСОТЫ БУФЕРА КОНСОЛИ (РЕЖИМ ПРОКРУТКИ)

Дополнительный ключ: /BufferHeight <высота буфера>. Примеры:
conemu /BufferHeight 9999 /cmd cmd.exe
conemu /bufferheight 1000 /cmd powershell.exe -noexit myscript.ps1

Если команда /cmd не задана, берется сохраненная команда из реестра, если есть,
а если нет, то в режиме прокрутки запускается 'cmd', а в стандартном режиме
сначала пытаемся запустить 'far', потом 'cmd'.

Проверка на слишком маленькую или слишком большую заданную высоту буфера не
делается, рекомендуется выбирать ее так, что она заведомо больше высоты окна (в
строках), но не больше 9999, что является магическим ограничением высоты буфера
в виндовом диалоге настроек консоли.

Режим прокрутки предназначен в первую очередь для интерактивных сессий в
оболочках типа Cmd или PowerShell и не предназначен для программ типа FAR.
FAR, как и раньше следует запускать без всяких /BufferHeight - при этом
установка родителя окна консоли ДЕЛАЕТСЯ, то есть плагины, которые этого
ожидают, это и получают.

ПРИМЕЧАНИЕ: если величина /BufferHeight отрицательная, то это является
указанием принудительно установить родителя консольного окна. Это может быть
нужно, например, для нормальной работы приложений или плагинов FAR, которые
ожидают, что у консоли родительское окно - это окно ConEmu. В таком режиме в
процессе выделения мышью выделение может скакнуть в левый верхний угол - как
бороться - пока неясно, но если продолжать выделение, оно 'восстанавливается'.
Фиксится это пока не будет, ибо по нормальному приложения должны находить окно
ConEmu более универсальным способом (от hoopoe, см. форум по ConEmu).

ОПИСАНИЕ РЕЖИМА ПРОКРУТКИ

*) Окно имеет стандартную вертикальную полосу прокрутки.
*) Управление прокруткой с клавиатуры:
- CtrlPgUp, CtrlPgDn листают страницы вверх-вниз
- CtrlUp, CtrlDn прокручивают вверх-вниз построчно
*) Работа с выделением только мышью: выделение - левой кнопкой с перемещением,
копирование и вставка - правой кнопкой.

ПРОЧИЕ ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ

*) Исправлен мелкий дефект в отрисовке курсора: он мог ошибочно оставаться
отрисованным в поле ввода после перехода с поля ввода на кнопку или другой
элемент диалога, при активации которого курсор должен скрываться.

ТЕХНИЧЕСКИЕ ПОДРОБНОСТИ

*) Реализована отрисовка выделения (работает только в режиме прокрутки).
*) В режиме прокрутки положение окна консоли подгоняется под положение мыши -
это нужно для корректной работы выделения в оригинальной консоли.
*) В режиме прокрутки при старте устанавливаем QuickEdit режим, это нужно для
возможности выделения мышью в оригинальной консоли.
*) Установка параметров окна консоли в буфер режиме (предложено hoopoe): при
первом вызове устанавливаем высоту буфера /BufferHeight, при последующих смотрим
на наличие вертикальной прокрутки: если есть, то сохраняем текущую высоту буфера
(она может быть уже и не равна /BufferHeight), иначе подгоняем под высоту окна.
*) WM_MOUSEWHEEL теперь обрабатывается как событие мыши, нужно для прокрутки.
*) WM_RBUTTONUP НЕ обрабатывается (как и было раньше), чтобы избежать
нежелательного появления консольного меню в некоторых ситуациях. Добавлен
комментарий в коде.
*) WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK преобразовывается в WM_RBUTTONDOWN (как и было раньше). По
задумке Zoin это помогает быстро быделить и тут же развыделить элемент панели
Фара двойным правым кликом (не знаю зачем, но считаем, что автору видней).
Добавлен комментарий в коде.

ПОНЕНЦИАЛЬНАЯ ПРОБЛЕМА ПЕРВОЙ ОТРИСОВКИ

При размерах окна равных дефолтным размерам консоли теоретически была возможна
неправильная первая отрисовка некоторых случайных символов (баг оптимизации).
Исправлено.

ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ В ЛОГИКЕ ОТРИСОВКИ КУРСОРА

При потере фокуса окна курсор оставался видимым или невидимым в зависимости от
его текущего состояния. Стандартное же поведение для неактивного окна - гасить
курсор. Сделано по стандартному.

Символ под курсором и некоторые идущие за ним иногда рисовались даже если это не
нужно; исправлено. Прирост скорости небольшой, но все ж так лучше.

ИСПРАВЛЕНА НАСТРОЙКА ШРИФТА BOLD

Настройка сохранялась, но считывалась неверно - исправлено.

ТЕХИНФО: АЛЬТЕРНАТИВНЫЙ ШРИФТ РАМОК

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla]
"FontName2"="Courier New"
"FontSizeX2"=hex:0b,00,00,00

FontName2 задает альтернативный шрифт рамок, 'Lucida Console' по умолчанию.
Однако, при основном шрифте, например, 'Consolas' спец. символы оказываются
шире, чем надо, и тогда 'Courier New' выглядит неплохой заменой.

В зависимости от разных параметров одного указания шрифта рамок может быть
недостаточно, и для точной настройки надо еще подогнать его ширину, то есть
параметр FontSizeX2. Демо: основной шрифт 'Consolas' 16 x 10, тогда для
рамочного 'Courier New' его ширина почему-то должна быть 11 (0xB).

ПРОЧИЕ КОСМЕТИЧЕСКИЕ ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ

Меню: текст &Settings заменен на S&ettings, чтобы избежать конфликта с хоткеем
пункта &Size в режиме обычного окна.

Слегка упрощена отрисовка с фоновой картинкой, когда происходит только
перемещение курсора, в комстроке, например.

Кое-где устранены лишние вспомогательные вызовы установки размера буфера консоли
(по-моему, лишние, но если у Zoin были на это виды - решать ему).



= Version 2008.02.23 =

ИЗМЕНЕНА ЛОГИКА ЗАПУСКА ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ

Было так: если команда пустая, то сначала запускается она, и в случае сбоя (а он
всегда) запускается Far или Cmd. Итого всегда лишняя попытка запустить пустую
команду. Если команда не пустая, но не запускается, то вместо сообщения о сбое
запускается Far или Cmd; это и нелогично, и может создать иллюзию, что команда
отработала, например, если конечной целью и был запуск Фара, но сначала должно
было выполниться что-то еще, что не отработало. Предлагается так: если команда
пуста, то запускаем Far или Cmd, если не пуста - запускаем ее, а в случае сбоя -
сообщаем об ошибке и выходим.

ТЕХИНФО: АЛЬТЕРНАТИВНЫЙ ШРИФТ ДЛЯ ИСПРАВЛЕНИЯ РАМОК

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\.Vanilla]
"FontName2"="courier new"

Задает альтернативный шрифт для исправления рамок; по умолчанию используется
шрифт 'lucida console', который неплох для самих рамок, но жирноват для прочих
специальных символов, отчего они слегка наезжают на соседей по ширине. 'courier
new' выглядит неплохой заменой, например, если основной шрифт 'consolas'.



= Version 2008.02.21 =

УВЕЛИЧЕНА СКОРОСТЬ ОТРИСОВКИ

В VirtualConsole::Update не перерисовываем символы, которые не изменились,
при этом делаем не только глобальную проверку в самом начале, но проверяем
каждый символ и атрибуты в самом процессе в цикле по строке. Это позволяет
избежать изрядного числа перерисовок. Особо проверяем и перерисовываем
символ под старой позицией курсора. Однако, если уже начали рисовать, то
рисуем максимум подходящих символов включая и неизменные (проверено, так
быстрее, чем несколько раз отрисовывать разрозненные цепочки).

Render time (округлено на глазок, в худшую для новой версии сторону):
*) В панелях старый вариант - 1000000 на любой операции, новый вариант -
набор в ком. строке - 2300, навигация вверх-вниз по файлам без прокрутки -
2500, с прокруткой - 150000.
*) В редакторе старый вариант - 850000 при любой операции, в новой версии -
перемещение без прокрутки - обычно не более 3000, с прокруткой зависит от
длины строк, ширины экрана и расцветки, на типичном файле с исходным кодом с
не очень длинными строками и с колорером ускорение в 3-4 раза.
*) Оптимизирована и форсированная перерисовка (весь экран, например, при
смене опций в диалоге), но разница в производительности не так заметна,
конечно.

Еще устранены несколько вероятно лишних перерисовок при запуске (один вызов,
когда окно еще не окончательное и один или два лишних прохода из-за курсора)

ИСПРАВЛЕН СИМВОЛ ПОД КУРСОРОМ В РЕЖИМЕ РАМОК

Наблюдался нежелательный эффект - символ под курсором в режиме исправления
рамок иногда рисовался юникодным фонтом (видимо, последним выбранным до
этого для рамок). Исправлено.
